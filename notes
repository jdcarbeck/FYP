Project Notes:

Also need to correct implementation of concept chain query
 â€¢ query term expansion

Issues with segmentation

With knowledge model terms generate the query terms and discount based of off material that is being read at the time. Example in article with discounting for query retrival

Need to start looking at demo version of system with document relation, as well as evaluation



Change corpus to work on a list of documents, or get topic term frequencys directly from the documents


Time complexity as an issues for sentences selection:
    Can be dealt with by choosing higher simlarity threshold such as .90 instead of .72
    Need to generate sentence pairings first then break them up into to proceesses to create the model

In terms of evaluation evaulate it based of query based reterival methods
Can only hint at personalsisation and say that the system is apt for being implemented with topic based user modeling
