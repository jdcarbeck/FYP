        "sauntering down leafy avenues past typical dutch step-gabled buildings , carpets of crocuses , the occasional cyclist whooshing quietly by and the sun bouncing off the canal , i can think of few more pleasant places to spend a spring weekend than the hague .", 
        "this is also prime territory for a gallery lover like me : the beautiful , elegant and not-too-big mauritshuis was restored last year . this is also the home of girl with a pearl earring , the ` dutch mona lisa ' .", 
        "but i am not only here for the vermeer , rembrandt and hals .", 
        "much more than a village : the parliament building stands proud in the hague - a hidden gem of a city .", 
        "there is the escher gallery -lrb- devoted to that geometry-defying genius -rrb- , the contemporary art gemeentemuseum and more .", 
        "meanwhile , i am being charmed by an unsuspected delight : this medieval city by the sea .", 
        "` city ? this is europe 's biggest village , ' says my guide , remco d\u00f6rr .", 
        "he is right : the hague , despite being home to holland 's royal family and an eye-catching parliament , was classed as a village until louis bonaparte -lrb- napoleon 's brother and king of holland -rrb- set up here in 1806 . it has a genteel moat/canal , which encircles the historic centre .", 
        "we step across and in front of an approaching car , which slows down deferentially .", 
        "remco tells me that many traffic lights have been taken out for aesthetic reasons . ` now , the cars are very careful , ' he says .", 
        "the hague is home to one of the cornerstones of european art - vermeer 's girl with a pearl earring .", 
        "you have to love that kind of dutch logic - though it does n't seem to apply to cyclists , who rule the place . next time , i will rent a bicycle , although the trams and buses are easy and cheap -lrb- an all-day pass costs \u20ac 7.70 / \u00a3 5.60 -rrb- .", 
        "over the moat , we are in noordeinde street .", 
        "remco ushers me into what used to be part of a palace , and still has huge chandeliers and ornate mirrors .", 
        "this cobbled part of town is home to private galleries and unassuming cafes -lrb- i snacked in the juni lekkernijen -rrb- , as well as altogether more assuming ones .", 
        "hanting is the latest michelin star in town and the best place for indonesian cuisine . the most prized dutch colony was apparently run from the hague -lrb- aka ` the widow of indonesia ' -rrb- .", 
        "for summer : the excellent grapes & olives and the caf\u00e9 de bieb on veenkade will have boats on a newly renovated bit of canal , with music and boat trips planned , including a tour at the kompaan brewery -lrb- i can vouch for the product -rrb- .", 
        "my art gorging finishes at the panorama , an extraordinary , 14 ft-high circular panorama of the hague 's seaside resort , scheveningen , painted by hendrik mesdag .", 
        "i take a 15-minute tram to the place itself and gorge on scallops and sole at catch by simonis on the harbour front . the hague has netted a new fan .",
