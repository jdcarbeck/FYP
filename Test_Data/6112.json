        "aside from making a fighter jet lightweight , agile and astonishingly fast , engineers of one the world 's most advanced aircraft have another , more surprising issue to contend with : the moon .", 
        "bae system 's typhoon is so accurate that even the movements of the tide can disrupt the jet fighter 's positioning and accuracy .", 
        "to counteract even the slightest shifts in gravitational pull , experts must build the jet on ` floating ' concrete rafts that move in sync with the moon .", 
        "the typhoon -lrb- pictured -rrb- is powered by two eurojet ej200 engines . it is 49ft -lrb- 15 metres -rrb- long from tip to tip and the material is ` no more than the thickness of a match stick . ' this helps its ` fly by wire ' computer system to accurately control the aircraft , designed to be unstable but hugely agile .", 
        "these rafts measure 59ft -lrb- 18 metres -rrb- long and 9.8 ft -lrb- 3 metres -rrb- thick and are used to house the measuring equipment .", 
        "two laser trackers and nine jacks are positioned on a single surface , to make sure all movement is relative , and they control the alignment of the barges by cancelling out the subtle effects of the moon and the tides it creates .", 
        "this means the jet will be in ` near perfect alignment whatever the moon may be doing , ' said martin topping , head of typhoon maintenance and upgrade .",

        "this helps its ` fly by wire ' computer system to accurately control the aircraft , designed to be unstable but hugely agile , and this build accuracy can save enough fuel to fill up an average family car , or around 60 litres .", 
        "the typhoon can take off in less than 8 seconds , achieve supersonic speeds in under 30 seconds and reach altitudes of 36,000 feet mach 1.6 in under two and a half minutes .", 
        "it is able to pull up to 9g , which creates a pressure equivalent to 30 african elephants .",

        "it takes light from the sun eight minutes to reach earth and the firm said the typhoon can travel from london to paris in the same time .", 
        "and it can fly from lands end to john ` o groats - a total of 603 miles -lrb- 970 km -rrb- - in under 30 mins .",
