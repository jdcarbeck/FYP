        "it looks like a cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft , but these strange vehicles are actually new new type of aircraft developed in china .", 
        "two prototypes of the cyg-11 seaplane were tested this week over the sea off the coast of haikou in hainan province in china .", 
        "the aircraft is believed to be a joint project between russia and china to build new types of super-efficient seaplane .", 
        "the cyg-11 seaplane -lrb- above -rrb- uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing-in-ground effect to glide .", 
        "the vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing-in-ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft 's wings are close to the ground .", 
        "length : 13m .", 
        "wingspan : 15.6 m .", 
        "weight : 3800 kg .", 
        "seats : 12 people .", 
        "maximum load : 1200 kg .", 
        "maximum range : 1500 km .", 
        "flight speed : 175 - 250 km/h .", 
        "flight height : 3-5 m .", 
        "wave height : 1.25 - 3 m .", 
        "by placing the wings low on the fuselage of the aircraft , this effect is increased and the the result is an aircraft that essentially floats on a cushion of air .", 
        "engineers behind the cny 5 billion -lrb- \u00a3 500 million -rrb- project say the aircraft are capable of flying 62 miles -lrb- 100 km -rrb- on 28 litres of fuel .", 
        "with a maximum range of 930 miles -lrb- 1,500 km -rrb- , the aircraft can reach a top speed of 155 mph -lrb- 250 km/h -rrb- .", 
        "the aircraft races over the wavetops at a height of between three to five metres -lrb- 9-15 feet -rrb- .", 
        "the cyg-11 aircraft , which have been developed by the hainan yingge wing in ground effect craft manufacturing company with russian engineers , can carry 10 passengers plus two flight crew .", 
        "the company claims to have just finished building a larger version of the aircraft capable of carrying 40 people , but it hopes to develop bigger aircraft capable of carrying between 55 and 120 passengers .", 
        "the hainan yingge wing in ground effect craft manufacturing company tested two prototypes of the plane .", 
        "the prototypes are designed to carry two pilots -lrb- above -rrb- and 10 passengers but larger craft are in development .", 
        "the plane can be used like a catamaran initially until it builds up enough speed to lift off from the ocean .", 
        "it says the aircraft could find uses for coastal defence , customs patrols and perhaps even be used as the public transport of the future along ` marine highways ' .", 
        "gu jianxin , a spokesman for the company , told the southern metropolis daily : ` the current technology research and development has matured into mass production .", 
        "` the main plan is to invest in tourism , freight , maritime search and rescue and other aspects . '", 
        "the cyg-11 -lrb- above -rrb- has been developed with russian engineers and could be used to patrol coastlines .", 
        "the aircraft -lrb- above -rrb- is designed to fly at low level between 3 m and 5 m above the surface of the ocean .", 
        "engineers say the aircraft -lrb- above -rrb- could even provide public transport of the future along ` marine highways '", 
        "he estimates that it will cost around $ 20 million dollars for each vessel .", 
        "powered by two large propellers at the front of the aircraft , the cyg-11 can be driven in the sea much like a catamaran .", 
        "once it reaches flight speed the aircraft 's wings will begin to lift it off the ocean and it will glide along on a cushion of air .", 
        "huang dong , one of the pilots who flew the aircraft during the tests , said : ` it felt like when you ride a motorboat then the feeling is just as comfortable as sitting on a plane . there are no boat bumps . '", 
        "the company are developing larger aircraft that they hope will be able to carry up to 120 passengers ."
