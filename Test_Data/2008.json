        "whatever you call them , it 's always something of a surprise when a game between the biggest and best teams in any country actually turns out to be a footballing classic .", 
        "real madrid and barcelona attract viewers , but the cynicism on the pitch can drown out the quality in el clasico . borussia dortmund are not consistently good enough to make der klassiker a regular spectacle . english football 's closest equivalent , liverpool taking on manchester united , is now merely a battle for the top four .", 
        "but , on easter sunday , marseille and paris st germain played out a game that not only had a huge bearing on the ligue 1 title race , but also easily lived up to it 's billing as le classique .", 
        "paris st germain players celebrate their win in the dressing room after the game , after twice coming from behind to beat rivals marseille .", 
        "andre-pierre gignac gets up above marquinhos to power home the opening goal for marseille after half an hour .", 
        "blaise matuidi is congratulated by his team-mates after bringing psg level with a superb curling effort from the edge of the box .", 
        "gignac fires home his second goal past salvatore sirigu after a mistake from marco veratti gave him a clear run on goal , to make it 2-1 .", 
        "marquinhos jumps for joy after slamming the ball into the roof of the net to make it 2-2 after zlatan ibrahimovic 's mis-hit free kick .", 
        "ibrahimovic put pressure on jeremy morel to force an own goal just two minutes later , as psg went ahead for the first time in the game .", 
        "marseille : mandanda , romao , fanni , morel , lemina , dja dj\u00e9dj\u00e9 , mendy , payet , thauvin -lrb- ocampos 63 mins -rrb- , gignac -lrb- batshuayi 71 -rrb- , ayew -lrb- alessandrini 72 -rrb- .",

        "in the end it was psg who ran out winners , but they twice had to come from behind to see off their fierce rivals in a game that had passion , quality , and goals aplenty .", 
        "the game was decided by a 130-second burst soon after the half-time break , in which the visitors came from 2-1 down to go 3-2 ahead , with zlatan ibrahimovic , predictably , involved in both goals , though not perhaps , in the way that would be expected .", 
        "first the swedish star slipped as he struck a free kick at goal , only to see his nothing effort land at the feet of brazilian defender marquinhos , who slammed the ball into the roof of the net from close range .", 
        "just two minutes later ibrahimovic might have been on hand to tap home javier pastore 's low cross , but in the end his presence was enough to force defender jeremy morel to divert it past his own goalkeeper .", 
        "it felt harsh on marseille , who were the better side for large periods , but they were let down by defensive frailties and an inability to really punhish the psg backline .", 
        "despite the hosts dominance of possession , the champions could easily have won this by three or four goals , such were their chances .", 
        "ibrahimovic had several excellent opportunities , the last of which saw steve mandanda pull off a remarkable save , while pastore should have scored at least once , and mandanda also did well to deny matuidi late on .", 
        "all of that without considering the chances the visitors missed before falling behind in the first half , with ibrahimovic denied a penalty following a clumsy tackle by morel , pastore firing wide when clean through , and the woefully out of form edinson cavani scuffing a volley straight at the keeper after being picked out by a beautiful chipped pass .",

        "dimitri payet gets a shot away under pressure from marco veratti of psg in the stade veledrome as marseille looked to take home advantage .", 
        "on the other hand it is difficult to remember salvatore sirigu making too many meaningful saves in the second half , although he did acrobatically tip a gignac header over the bar shortly before the break to deny the striker a hat-trick .", 
        "with lyon having briefly gone top of the table by beating guingamp earlier in the weekend , it was a game both sides really needed to win to keep up their title challenges . the result puts laurent blanc 's men top of ligue 1 again , and is a serious dent to marseille 's hopes .", 
        "it all looked so different at half time , when an andre-pierre gignac double had his side 2-1 up . the local-born hero first rose above marquinhos at the back post to head past sirigu on the half-hour , before slotting past the italian shortly before half time to restore the lead .", 
        "both goals had an element of fortune , with gignac climbing all over his defender to convert dimitri payet 's cross , and marco veratti gifting him possession through on goal for the second , but nonetheless he took both well .", 
        "in between was the pick of the goals , a stunner from blaise matuidi , who cut inside beautifully , before curling in from the edge of the box , via the fingertips of mandanda and the inside of the post .", 
        "psg 's win was marred only by an injury to david luiz , withdrawn in the first half with what looked like a hamstring pull . but a win over their fierce rivals , and the return to the table 's summit , will soften that blow .", 
        "david luiz is brought down , and the brazilian defender was forced off soon after with a hamstring injury which looked serious .", 
        "marseille took the lead twice in the first half , but on both occasions they were unable to stay ahead for too long .",
