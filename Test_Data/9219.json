        "a text message intended for a senior aide to george osborne -- but accidentally sent to a newspaper -- yesterday divulged plans for a ` tax free minimum wage ' .",

        "new plan : the details of george osborne 's leaked plans are unclear , but it is believed to mean that minimum wage earners wouldn ' t be paying any income tax .",

        "labour 's ed miliband yesterday pledged that he would help low earners by raising the level above \u00a3 8 an hour by october 2019 .",

        "david cameron said in his speech to the conservative party conference last year that he wanted to see the threshold for paying income tax -- currently \u00a3 10,600 -- go up to \u00a3 12,500 by april 2020 . this will take an extra million people out of income tax altogether , while giving 30million workers a tax cut worth \u00a3 500 a year .",
