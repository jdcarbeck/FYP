        "who can resist boden 's bright knits and floral prints ? i most certainly ca n't writes clare goldwin .", 
        "well , not when it comes to my seven-year-old , ella , anyway .", 
        "for years , i 've happily forked out on pricey but irresistibly cute items for her from mini boden . but when it comes to buying clothes from boden for myself , i 've always steered clear .", 
        "their traditional and instantly recognisable staples of cotton shifts and ` mumsy ' jersey dresses , not to mention ` jaunty ' prints in eye-catching colours , have always been a big no-no for me .", 
        "clare goldwin -lrb- pictured -rrb- admits that she will sometimes fork out for boden 's brightly printed clothes for her daughter but not herself as she does n't want to be labelled a boden ` yummy mummy '", 
        "who wants to be labelled a boden ` yummy mummy ' at 50 paces , and bump into countless other mothers in identical uniforms on the school-run ?", 
        "for many years , boden -- which launched in 1991 -- made a success of its appeal to the ` sloane ' market . but recently , the company has experienced more challenging times .", 
        "profits plummeted 42 per cent in 2011 and , while they rose again in 2012 , they remained flat for 2013 .", 
        "now , however , boden seems to have finally cracked it , and the fashion world is raving about their latest collections .", 
        "glossy magazines have praised their spring/summer shoe range for its nods to designer brands . and they 've even seduced the notoriously difficult u.s. market , where sales are soaring .", 
        "experts are putting the success down to the use of luxury fabrics , with more cashmere and silk mixes , plus more limited-edition pieces -- so there 's less chance of bumping into someone wearing the same outfit .", 
        "they 're also attracting customers by toning down their colour palette , so the look is not so ` sweet shop ' , and making many of the prints more sophisticated and subtle .", 
        "so , can this latest collection keep its core , middle-class customers happy , while appealing to the more fashionable woman ?", 
        "with the mid-season sale now on , i tried a selection of their latest outfits to see whether this boden sceptic could be persuaded ...", 
        "top trousers .", 
        "colour-block coat , was \u00a3 179 , now \u00a3 107.40 ; jumper , was \u00a3 89 , now \u00a3 53.40 ; trousers , were \u00a3 69 , now \u00a3 48.30 ; suede-heeled sandals , \u00a3 119 -lrb- all boden.co.uk -rrb- .", 
        "i usually avoid boden , fearing it will make me look frumpy . and on the hanger , these trousers look like a case in point -- with their elasticated waist , they look like shapeless tracksuit bottoms .", 
        "once on , though , they 're bang on trend , with slim legs tapering to an elasticated cuff . i 'd even wear them for an evening out -- though perhaps in a plain colour .", 
        "the jumper has three-quarter sleeves and cute french-knot decorations like little flowers . meanwhile , the two-tone coat has been carefully considered , down to contrast stitching in the lining . the darker blocks are slimming , too , though the green is a bit insipid for my taste . 3/5 .", 
        "fab ... if i was 20 !", 
        "dress , was \u00a3 199 , now \u00a3 119.40 ; mules , were \u00a3 119 , now \u00a3 89.25 .", 
        "at first glance , this dress looks like classic ` yummy mummy ' boden . and it does me no favours -- making me look mumsy , busty and frumpy . that 's not because the dress is dowdy , but because it 's too fashion-forward -- and i 'm too old to be wearing it .", 
        "with its a-line sixties silhouette and alarmingly thigh-skimming length , this is the sort of frock that might be found in topshop .", 
        "it would look fantastic on a lithe 20-year-old or someone more flat-chested . sadly , it does n't flatter this 42-year-old mother-of-two . it 's hard to work out if this is a miss by boden , or the company taking aim at a younger crowd .", 
        "the mules are very on-trend , though , and , with their teetering heel , far from the sensible-heeled shoes i associate with boden . 2/5 .", 
        "perky print .", 
        "geometric print dress , was \u00a3 99 , now \u00a3 69.30 ; suede t-bar heels with green tassels , \u00a3 119 .", 
        "this purple and tangerine geometric shift is a world away from boden 's usual floral prints .", 
        "it would work well on bustier women , as the smaller pattern on the upper half helps minimise larger breasts , while the plain band accentuates the waist .", 
        "the length is just above the knee , so it 's not too daring for those over 40 -- though i would n't want it any shorter .", 
        "meanwhile , the shoes are fab . the t-bar heels are right on trend and come with a twist : contrasting purple toes and quirky green tassel detail .", 
        "usually , ankle straps make legs look shorter by cutting them off -- but here , the strap sits lower down the foot , lengthening and flattering the legs . 3/5 .", 
        "fifties wonder .", 
        "floral dress , was \u00a3 139 , now \u00a3 97.30 ; mules , were \u00a3 119 , now \u00a3 89.25 .", 
        "on first sight , this look screams old-style boden -- a cotton shift dress in a flower print . but , unlike the shapeless floral shifts of old , this one is cut in a very fashionable fifties shape , with a square neckline and tulip skirt .", 
        "the viscose/cotton fabric has a sheen to it , which gives a luxurious feel , and the flowers are big and bold -- almost abstract -- with flashes of lime that stop it all from looking too girly . it 's chintzy , but in a good way .", 
        "this is also a slightly longer , more flattering , length and would be great for a wedding or summer party .", 
        "the mules -- this time in lime -- are the perfect finishing touch . 5/5 .", 
        "slimming skirt .", 
        "cashmere jumper , was \u00a3 99 , now \u00a3 49.50 ; print pencil skirt , was \u00a3 89 , now \u00a3 62.30 ; suede-heeled sandals , were \u00a3 119 , now \u00a3 95.20 .", 
        "i would never have guessed this pink and green , diamond-print , cotton pencil skirt was from boden .", 
        "it 's a more eye-catching look than i 'm used to wearing , and i 'd usually shy away from crew-neck jumpers , too , as i think the high neckline accentuates my broad shoulders .", 
        "but once on , the warm , pink sweater suits my pale colouring and the effect of the skirt is eye-catching , sharp and very slimming .", 
        "the length is on the knee for me -- but i 'm 5 ft 10 in , so for most women , this would come in just below the knee . with 3 per cent elastane , there 's also a little forgiving stretch .", 
        "i pair it with the suede sandals , this time in pink . still love them . this look is a surprise hit . 4/5 .", 
        "floaty dream .", 
        "cream silk shirt , \u00a3 99 ; floral skirt , \u00a3 99 ; sandals , as before .", 
        "oooh , this silk shirt and full skirt combination looks like the sort of outfit i remember my mum wearing in the eighties . but will i look like a mumsy frump ?", 
        "while the skirt is in a traditional floral print , it 's not made from plain cotton , as you might expect from boden , but has a gorgeous organza silk overlay , so it 's floaty and delicate .", 
        "while the full skirt style is n't very slimming , it 's a fifties shape that 's right on trend and swishes nicely .", 
        "the blouse is very similar to those made by chic french brand equipment , even down to the breast pocket detail . except there , blouses will set you back over \u00a3 200 , while this is half that .", 
        "again , i love the shoes . these suede sandals are simple , elegant and very comfortable . 3/5 .", 
        "eighties horror .", 
        "blouse , was \u00a3 69 , now \u00a3 48.30 ; skinny pants , \u00a3 49 ; pointed slingback flats , \u00a3 79 ; leather bag , was \u00a3 110 , now \u00a3 82.50 .", 
        "this is my least favourite look . the floaty , geometric top has a very orla kiely-esque print , but i think it makes me look dowdy .", 
        "meanwhile , the stretchy , navy pants give me nasty flashbacks to the leggings i used to wear as a teenager in the eighties , and they make my legs look stumpy and lumpy .", 
        "however , the slingback flats in a pretty aqua are very fashion-forward -- designers ranging from jimmy choo to antonio berardi have brought out pointed , flat slingbacks this season . and the aqua bag is very ladylike . 2/5 .", 
        "so , am i convinced ?", 
        "ok , there 's a lot that will keep faithful boden fans happy , but i 've been reassured there are enough new pieces to make even sceptics like me look past its mumsy bright prints .", 
        "in particular i love the shoes . they 've definitely persuaded me to put in an order ."
