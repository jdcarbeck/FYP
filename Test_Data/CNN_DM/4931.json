        "the days of weather presenters -lrb- stock image -rrb- could be numbered . researchers from london and edinburgh have developed a computer that can collate meterological information and then produce forecasts as if they were written by a human . it uses a process known as ` natural language generation ' -lrb- nlg -rrb- .", 
        "these computer-generated weather updates are being being tested by scientists at heriot-watt university and university college london .", 
        "using met office data , the researchers are developing new algorithms for automatically generating detailed reports .", 
        "if the project is successful , a prototype system will be tested by generating local weather reports on the bbc 's website .", 
        "currently , the bbc website features 10 reports written by meteorologists .", 
        "each of these forecasts cover a large area of the country , such as london and south east england , but there are more than 20,000 individual locations that need tailored reports .", 
        "using met office data , the researchers are developing new algorithms for automatically generating weather reports . if the project is successful a prototype system will be tested by generating local weather reports on the mailonline 's website -lrb- shown -rrb- , which currently features just 10 reports for large areas of the country .", 
        "nlg is the process of producing readable texts in english , or other languages , automatically on a computer .",

        "the project is called domain-independent language generation -lrb- diligent -rrb- and is being run by dr verena rieser from heriot-watt university 's school of mathematical and computer science , with dr andreas vlachos and dr sebastian riedel from the computer science department at university college london .", 
        "` machine learning for natural language processing -lrb- nlp -rrb- is what diligent is all about , ' said dr rieser .",

        "` the uk is a world leader in this kind of research but we are under-represented in using machine learning approaches for nlg . this project will help to strengthen this research strand . '",
