        "the rangers boss has spoken to tunisian defender bilel mohsni -lrb- 2nd left -rrb- about his discipline .", 
        "` i 've had to have a word with him over his concentration levels , ' said mccall . ` he did some absolutely outstanding things in the game and then he did some slack and sloppy things .", 
        "` i did n't know what he was booked for and kenny -lrb- black -rrb- had said it was a reaction to their fans . he was probably frustrated and angry at the result .",

        "` there will be a lot of big games , big crowds , tension and drama until the last kick of the season , ' added mccall ` so cool heads is the way to go . but i still like fire in the belly . i do n't want people to surrender meekly and mildly . nothing wrong with a bit of passion as long as it 's channelled in the right way .

        "mccall insisted the palmerston reverse should n't be viewed as a ` disaster ' and feels he already has evidence of his side 's ability to recover from disappointments .", 
        "` we just have to draw a line under it . i do n't want doom and gloom . we drew the first two games when i came here . that was n't what we wanted , so we bounced back from those . we then went on a decent run and now we 've had another setback . it 's about how we react . '"
