        "ford was obsessed with efficiency : his production lines were inspired by the meat-packing yards of chicago and it became the first mass produced car in the united states .", 
        "his famous decree that customers could choose ` any colour so long as it is black ' was not to limit consumer choice , but to reduce costs .", 
        "in ford 's day , freshly painted cars were left in the sun to dry .", 
        "black dried more quickly and was thus cheaper . by 1914 , a model t could be manufactured in 93 minutes and spare parts were all available through the sears roebuck mail-order catalogue for drivers to install themselves ."
