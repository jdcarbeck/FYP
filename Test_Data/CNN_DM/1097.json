        "football agents were left in limbo on wednesday as they awaited news on new regulations .", 
        "as of april 1 , the licensing system for agents is to change so that anyone can become a football agent as long as they pay \u00a3 500 for an initial one-year registration period .", 
        "the fa will then charge \u00a3 250 for every subsequent year of renewal . already established licensed agents were exempt .", 
        "the fa is due to place a link on their website for intermediaries to register , but as of 1 pm that was still not in place .", 
        "mel stein thinks the new regulations on becoming a football agent will ` create anarchy '", 
        "the new guidelines have come in after fifa effectively washed their hands of governing agents .", 
        "fifa recommendations include national associations registering only intermediaries of ` impeccable character ' , all deals annually published online , agents ' fees limited to three per cent and no monies earned by them for negotiating deals for players under the age of 18 .", 
        "the fa , premier league and football league have been discussing how best to cope with fifa opting out . all have serious concerns about how the system will work in britain and abroad , especially in under-developed football territories .", 
        "mel stein , chairman of the london-based association of football agents , told the guardian : ` i think it 's going to create anarchy and everybody is going to be sorry about it . fifa could n't cope so they decided to hand it over to the individual territories .", 
        "manchester united striker radamel falcao -lrb- right -rrb- with his agent jorge mendes pictured last year .", 
        "` i can see the bloke in the pub who knows a parent or a footballer 's dad saying ` i 'll represent you ' and then undercutting everyone . '", 
        "` it is clearly wrong and anti-competitive to have this kind of price-capping . the fa are saying we 've got to do it because that 's what fifa are telling us to do . the three per cent cap will destroy the business of probably 50 % of my members . '", 
        "afa -lrb- association of football agents -rrb- has been holding discussions to reach a compromise and have pushed for self regulating . james featherstone of omnisports said : ` it 's a big worry for clubs how they keep a check on who is who . these new rules will allow anyone to register as an intermediary acting on behalf of a player .
