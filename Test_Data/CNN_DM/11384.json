        "in 2011 the unmanned dawn spacecraft became humanity 's first ever emissary to the huge asteroid vesta , which resides in the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter .", 
        "and using images collected by the spacecraft , nasa has unveiled an interactive tool that lets you explore this world .", 
        "using the map you can see a huge amount of features on vesta , from craters to the amount of sunlight hitting the surface - and switching to ` 3d mode ' also lets you fly around like you were in your own spacecraft .", 
        "called vesta trek , the interactive programme lets you explore massive craters on the body - which has no atmosphere , and thus no protection like our own earth .", 
        "vesta , discovered in 1807 , is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet ceres - which dawn has now travelled to .", 
        "it completes a rotation every five hours and 18 minutes , with a temperature ranging from -3 \u00b0c -lrb- 27 \u00b0f -rrb- to -188 \u00b0c -lrb- -306 \u00b0f -rrb- .", 
        "some meteorites on earth have been found to originate from places like vesta .", 
        "as you explore the asteroid , you will come across various ` troughs ' - areas where the ground sinks away . the largest of these is up to 12 miles -lrb- 20 km -rrb- wide and 289 miles -lrb- 465 km -rrb- long , similar in size to the grand canyon on earth .", 
        "elsehwere there are craters , hills and mountains on the surface , most formed by impacts .", 
        "on the map you can switch between three main views - over the north pole , a global view or looking down onto the south pole .", 
        "various tools also let you find out more information about the asteroid . you can draw lines on the surface to see elevation levels , place a pin to see how the angle of the sun changes at a location over time , or even draw a box to generate files to use with a 3d printer .", 
        "there 's also an option to 3d print an entire model of vesta .", 
        "nasa scientists in california have revealed an interactive 3d map for vesta -lrb- shown -rrb- using images from the dawn spacecraft . the map lets you see features on the surface including craters , hills , mountains and even ` canyons '", 
        "you can also measure elevation changes on the surface and see different measurement data . and a ` gaming mode ' lets you fly around the largest asteroid in the solar system using your keyboard 's arrow keys .", 
        "in the bottom right of the map is a scale , where you can change the units of measurement by clicking .", 
        "aside from using imperial and metric units of measurement - kilometres and miles - it also lets you measure distances in golden gate bridges , football fields and school buses .", 
        "various data can also be overlayed on the map , such as the amount of iron or hydrogen in certain regions .", 
        "the dawn spacecraft spent a year , from 2011 to 2012 , mapping and exploring vesta . it is so large compared to other asteroids that is sometimes referred to as a minor planet .", 
        "the spacecraft is now orbiting the dwarf planet ceres , and over the next few months will be spiraling down closer and closer to image more of it .", 
        "you can draw lines on the surface to see elevation levels -lrb- shown -rrb- , place a pin to see how the angle of the sun changes at a location over time , or even draw a box to generate files to use with a 3d printer .", 
        "the dawn spacecraft spent a year , from 2011 to 2012 , mapping and exploring vesta -lrb- illustration shown -rrb- . it is so large compared to other asteroids that is sometimes referred to as a minor planet ."
