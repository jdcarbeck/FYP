        "the 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks .",

        "expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger , never mind about the gaping white hole left behind !", 
        "close enough ! tilting the tower 45 degrees , and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to ` improve ' the picture .", 
        "super hero ! in a hulk-like fashion , not only has van de ven knocked over the eiffel tower , but also has it grasped in two fingers .", 
        "van de ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures .",

        "why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the eiffel tower ? -lrb- still without it making contact ! -rrb- .", 
        "see double ! that works ! not only does he touch the top , he does it twice in this picture .", 
        "a portal has allowed the tip of the tower to protrude near the blogger 's feet so he can touch the tip .", 
        "why not ignore the failed hand all together , and just reposition it on top ? job done ! -lrb- left -rrb- or why not reverse the original photograph ? -lrb- right -rrb- .",
