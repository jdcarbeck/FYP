        "dysart , who also played coach in the original 1972 broadway production of jason miller 's pulitzer prize-winning `` that championship season , '' died sunday at home in santa monica after a long illness , his wife , artist kathryn jacobi , told the hollywood reporter .", 
        "the acclaimed `` l.a. law '' -- created by steven bochco -lrb- who eventually handed off the series to david e. kelley -rrb- and terry louise fisher -- aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994 . for playing the founder of the firm mckenzie , brackman , chaney and kuzak , dysart was nominated for the emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years , finally winning the trophy in 1992 .", 
        "`` i always had him in mind for that role , '' bochco said in a 2002 interview with the archive of american television . `` he 's so avuncular . so i reached out to him . you know , dick is sort of an old hippie . so he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit , and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie . he was perfect . ''", 
        "`` we got together , mapped out the character 's past to give us a basis from which to work , and it 's all gone smoothly since then , '' dysart said in a 1990 interview with the seattle times . `` sometimes i worry -- it 's all been going too well -- a role i love to play in a series that 's about as good as you can get . something 's wrong !
