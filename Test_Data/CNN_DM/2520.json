        "the 2005 clash -- widely remembered for the chaotic scenes in which brazilian goalkeeper dida was knocked to the ground by a flare - was the second time in two seasons the sides had met in the knockout stages as the pair threatened continental dominance to add to their monopoly on serie a.", 
        "european success did follow in the form of one title apiece -- milan lifting the trophy in 2007 and inter followed suit in 2010 -- but both have seen their stock dwindle severely in the past few years .", 
        "the pair have vacated the champions league scene and their form in serie a suggests they wo n't be rejoining europe 's elite any time soon . milan - europe 's most decorated club - are 15 points off the champions league pace in ninth . inter are a point and place further behind .", 
        "failure to qualify for next season -- when the san siro plays host to the final - will see both sides absent for the second year in a row . never before has europe 's biggest competition gone consecutive campaigns without any representation from italy 's second city . for now , supporters have the derby alone to look forward to next term .",
