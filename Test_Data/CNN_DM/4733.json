        "nico rosberg was brooding , his face stony , his eyes fixed on the middle distance and his fingers intermittently clapping in anger .", 
        "he was sitting next to lewis hamilton -- as close as the german had got to his mercedes team-mate all afternoon of the chinese grand prix -- at a post-race press conference fizzing with recriminations .", 
        "rosberg , whose usual coiffured , euro-chic sheen had vanished , alleged that hamilton had selfishly tried to spoil his race .", 
        "the record states that hamilton won , rosberg was second and ferrari 's sebastian vettel third . but rosberg feared he might be overtaken by vettel before the second round of pit stops when hamilton , then leading from pole position , slowed down a few fractions of a second -- to conserve his tyres , he said .",

        "rosberg asked the team to get hamilton to speed up , an instruction they issued and one with which the briton complied . ` i was n't controlling his race ; i was controlling my own race , ' said hamilton , indignantly . ` i had no real threat from nico . '", 
        "but rosberg said : ` it 's interesting to hear from you , lewis , that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace . that opened up the opportunity for sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me . '", 
        "hamilton countered : ` my job is to manage the car and bring the car home as fast as possible and that 's what i did . i did n't do anything intentionally to slow the cars up . '", 
        "boys , boys . it took a little longer last season for the old karting friends to sling so much mud in public . we are only three races into a 19-round saga and the brickbats and mutual suspicions are already tumbling out .", 
        "it was easy to sympathise with rosberg but difficult to agree with him . even though he was somewhat stronger here than during the opening two race weekends , he must be reaching his wits ' end , frustrated to distraction , wondering how on earth he can possibly beat hamilton when he is on form .", 
        "it seems , to this cod psychologist , that it was rosberg 's deep exasperation that led him to behave as he did .", 
        "niki lauda , the mercedes chairman , came to his not guilty verdict immediately after the race . ` we have first and second , ' said the three-time world champion .", 
        "hamilton salutes the crowd as he makes his way on to the podium to collect his trophy for winning the chinese grand prix .", 
        "daniel ricciardo -lrb- left -rrb- and daniil kvyat battle for position on track - the latter was forced to retire after an engine failure .", 
        "hamilton is covered in champagne by rosberg as the mercedes pair celebrate a one-two finish .", 
        "` i do n't care if there is a quarrel , as long as vettel is only third . one thing is clear : lewis had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end . there 's nothing more to say . true , lewis will drive selfishly . these guys are egocentric b ****** s . it is the only way to win the championship , and nico is the same if the s *** hits the fan . lewis was better this weekend .", 
        "` there is no friendship out there . when you race you have to fight , that 's it . '", 
        "for hamilton it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track , the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season , ending up in a gravel trap , his championship hopes devastated in 2007 .", 
        "he again finished the race at a relatively low speed as marshals failed to clear max verstappen 's crippled toro rosso . the safety car came out . anti-climax though it was , a giant roar erupted from the 29,000-strong main grandstand as the chequered flag was waved for hamilton .", 
        "he was congratulated over the radio for having ` the full house ' : pole , fastest lap and race win . it was a flawless performance .", 
        "the race posed many tantalising questions . the first was whether ferrari could match mercedes in the temperate shanghai climate , as they managed in malaysia a fortnight ago ?", 
        "they were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook rosberg . they will keep mercedes on their toes , and that is balm for the sport .", 
        "hamilton takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the shanghai international circuit .", 
        "rosberg appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team-mate hamilton at the third consecutive race .", 
        "hamilton , who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year 's title , made the perfect start . he inclined his car right on the grid , covering rosberg next to him , before darting through the first , right-hand corner in front . contest over before it started .", 
        "an honourable mention for 17-year-old verstappen , who drove his toro rosso with great elan . he put his car down the inside of marcus ericsson 's sauber , causing max 's father and former racer jos to exhale in relief as he watched the dangerous move from the garage . he then applauded in admiration .", 
        "alas , verstappen 's engine gave up on him and he left his machine parked on the start-finish straight .", 
        "red bull 's woes continued with daniil kvyat 's renault engine billowing grey smoke into the shanghai air . their other car , driven by daniel ricciardo , was ninth .", 
        "mclaren were even less successful than red bull , again . jenson button was demoted a place to 14th , having collided with pastor maldonado 's lotus .", 
        "button 's team-mate fernando alonso was 12th after being lapped by vettel , his replacement at ferrari . vettel was smiling afterwards , but not as widely as hamilton .", 
        "max verstappen starred once more following a number of thrilling passes , but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired .", 
        "jenson button , who finished 13th , was involved in a collision with pastor maldonado towards the end of the race ."
