        "the australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to \u00a3 9,714.40 in fares , claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket , and take into account annual leave .", 
        "but prosecutor malachy pakenham told westminster magistrates ' court : ` if it is accepted that the loss was \u00a3 23,000 , this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the united kingdom .", 
        "` the crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it .", 
        "` the train company are experts , not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed , you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket , you calculate it on a full single fare , of the return for the day , each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket ' .",

        "barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor .", 
        "when he turned his back barnett ran away , but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day .", 
        "an investigation was carried out by british transport police , which found the lawyer had dodged fares since april 2012 .", 
        "the lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law , despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an african children 's charity and director of leading think-tank , the legatum institute foundation , aimed at ` promoting prosperity ' .", 
        "a court heard how the barrister got off at london marylebone -lrb- pictured -rrb- by tapping out with an oyster card .", 
        "it is understood he did so by boarding a train at haddenham and thame parkway without a ticket , and then getting off at marylebone by simply tapping out with an oyster card .", 
        "because there was no start point to his journey , the automated system charged him the maximum transport for london fare , which is currently \u00a3 7.60 . but this is still far less than the \u00a3 19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home .", 
        "the case was adjourned until july 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to chiltern railways .",

        "burrows had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing southeastern trains the full amount in unpaid tickets , accrued over five years , within three days of being caught ."
