        "the plans were in a memo leaked to apple fansite 9to5mac in which mr cook wrote : ` i know that many of you have been looking forward to choosing an apple watch for yourselves , and we want to make it easy for you .", 
        "` starting friday a special employee purchase plan will offer a 50 % discount on any apple watch or apple watch sport for your personal use . '", 
        "notably , the discount does n't apply to the expensive edition model , which starts at $ 10,000 in the us and \u00a3 8,000 in the uk .", 
        "mr cook continued that as the watch is introduced in more countries , this price plan will be extended .",

        "apple 's watch goes on display around the world on 10 april and people can pre-order it at 12.01 pacific time -lrb- 8 am bst -rrb- on this day . the watch will then go on general sale on 24 april in the us , uk , australia , canada , china , france , germany , hong kong and japan .", 
        "earlier this week , apple released the first four guided tour videos of its watch , and said more are ` coming soon . ' these videos -lrb- pictured -rrb- include an introduction to the main features , plus how to use the messages app , customise the face , and use digital touch .",

        "like many firms , apple staff already reportedly receive a discount across the product range and this is said to be around 30 per cent .", 
        "according piper jaffray senior analyst gene munster , apple will sell a million watches in its first weekend on sale , three times the first-day sales of apple 's last all-new product , the ipad .", 
        "it would put the apple watch behind apple 's first ipad , which sold 3 million in its first weekend in 2010 , but ahead of the first iphone , which sold 700,000 units when it debuted in 2007 .", 
        "however , it would be a fraction of the 10 million iphone 6 and 6 pluses sold in the same timespan .", 
        "the half-price watch discounts apply from friday and will last for 90 days .", 
        "it is not clear whether employees can buy multiple watches under the scheme and apple has refused to comment .", 
        "mr cook added : ` congratulations to everyone who has worked to help this product reach our customers .", 
        "` and thanks in advance to the thousands of retail employees around the world who will start placing it on people 's wrists starting friday . '", 
        "although going on display in stores this weekend , the apple watch wo n't go on sale generally until the 24 april .", 
        "although it could be seen as a way to boost sales , ernest doku telecoms expert at uswitch.com , told mailonline the plans will benefit customers : ` apple knows it 's wading into unchartered territory with a costly , and as yet unproven , device .", 
        "` what better way to instill the idea the watch is a must-have accessory than offer deep discounts for its biggest evangelists ?", 
        "the videos also give an overview of how to see more options by pressing the screen . these options change depending on the app being used . for instance , when working out , it lets a wearer stop the workout .", 
        "the left-hand image shows how the digital crown can be used to select from a list of emoticons . the right-hand image shows the crown being used to select contacts after the button on the side has been pressed .", 
        "` it means those on the front line have actual experience they can draw on when making sales , and a stronger narrative for prospective buyers . '", 
        "according piper jaffray senior analyst gene munster , apple is expected to sell a million watches in its first weekend on sale , three times the first-day sales of apple 's last all-new product , the ipad .",
