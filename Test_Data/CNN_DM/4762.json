        "style over substance .", 
        "this game is being billed as beauty v the beast , but do n't underestimate arsene wenger . it 's not just about style -- he plays to win . the philosophy wenger has imposed has made arsenal popular throughout the world . people love to watch them , certainly more than jose mourinho 's teams .", 
        "but on sunday , he is up against the ultimate pragmatist -- mourinho finds any way to win . chelsea have conceded just two goals in their last six clashes with arsenal , keeping four clean sheets in the process . mourinho does exactly what 's necessary .", 
        "so while wenger always aims to win , he still cares about the brand of football played . mourinho 's brand is winning .", 
        "arsene wenger -lrb- left -rrb- pushed jose mourinho when chelsea beat arsenal 6-0 at stamford bridge last season .", 
        "wenger can not be underestimated , according to martin keown ... it 's not all about style , he plays to win .", 
        "talking tactics .", 
        "arsenal should dominate possession while chelsea are more likely to sit deep and use the electric pace of eden hazard and willian on the break . chelsea will be very disciplined and in some ways that is a shame because the players are n't allowed to express themselves as they might .", 
        "in the reverse fixture in october , chelsea pressed arsenal all over and wenger 's side were stifled -- they did not get a shot on target for the first time in a premier league match since 2003 . jose creates such an intensity and focus that winning becomes a matter of life and death .", 
        "but arsenal will send waves of players forward at pace and try to isolate branislav ivanovic , gary cahill and john terry , who are not the quickest .", 
        "keown -lrb- right -rrb- and wenger go back a long way , after keown 's two stints at arsenal during his career .", 
        "chelsea boss mourinho always finds a way to win and has a brilliant record against wenger .", 
        "change the record .", 
        "mourinho 's record over wenger is remarkable . not many managers can say they have never lost to arsene wenger . jose feels he knows wenger 's game and the arsenal boss ca n't surprise him . i 'd be amazed if chelsea go all out to attack , but they will still pack a punch on the break .", 
        "flavour of the month .", 
        "jose wants to win every trophy going but he has a poor record in the premier league manager of the month award . he has only won it three times , the same as alan curbishley and one fewer than joe kinnear . wenger has won it 14 times .", 
        "the cesc difference .", 
        "cesc fabregas has enjoyed a brilliant season at chelsea but i do n't think he would have necessarily benefited arsenal had he joined . that central midfield area is very congested and he would have halted aaron ramsey 's progress . but one thing is certain on sunday -- he wo n't receive a warm welcome .", 
        "mourinho has a poor premier league manager of the month record ; he has won as many as alan curbishley .", 
        "cesc fabregas has been impressive this season , but he would n't necessarily have been as good with arsenal ."
