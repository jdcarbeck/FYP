        "a japan railway maglev train hit 603 kilometers per hour -lrb- 374 miles per hour -rrb- on an experimental track in yamanashi tuesday , setting a decisive new world record .", 
        "a spokesperson said the train spent 10.8 seconds traveling above 600 kilometers per hour , during which it covered 1.8 kilometers -lrb- 1.1 miles -rrb- .", 
        "that 's nearly 20 football fields in the time it took you to read the last two sentences .",

        "`` i was moved just like many other visitors here today , '' he told cnn . `` this maglev project ... -lrb- increases -rrb- the hope that japan can have a good growth again in the future . ''", 
        "the train broke its own record from last thursday , when it ran at 590 kilometers per hour -lrb- 366 miles per hour -rrb- on a test track .",

        "unlike traditional trains , maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward .", 
        "japan 's maglevs do n't use metal tracks -- instead , they float nearly 10 cm -lrb- 4 inches -rrb- above special guideways , allowing for frictionless movement .",
