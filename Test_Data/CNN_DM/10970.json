        "space lasers : dr adrian quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like star wars -lrb- pictured -rrb- .", 
        "dr adrian quarterman , of dundee university , is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy , the times reported .", 
        "the satellites will orbit the earth , covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light .", 
        "the energy it then creates , using semi-conductors , can be shot back down to earth .", 
        "if it works , it could mean solar power could even become viable in scotland , or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas .", 
        "the physicist told the times : ` what this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving . '", 
        "initial trials in scotland were successful , but dr quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to portugal .",

        "unlike the lasers in the movies , however , they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon , let alone blow up a planet .", 
        "and it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week , which could see the international space station fitted with lasers to clear up ` space junk ' .", 
        "the system , suggested by researchers at the riken research institute in tokyo , would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles -lrb- 100 km -rrb- away .", 
        "powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into earth 's atmosphere , where it would burn up .", 
        "but this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon : the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size .", 
        "however , dr quarterman has acknowledged you ` might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control ' of his satellites ."
