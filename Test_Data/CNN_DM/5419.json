        "humans may have been lighting fires since we lived in caves and dined on woolly mammoth , but now there 's 21st century way to create a flame .", 
        "a new lighter uses electricity to ignite , and it 's claimed to be the first flameless gadget of its kind .", 
        "the device , called the illume arclighter , creates a ` super high-intensity ' electrical arc and contains a rechargeable lithium-ion battery so users will never run out of fuel at a tricky moment again .", 
        "a bright idea : a new lighter -lrb- pictured -rrb- uses electricity to ignite candles and paper for example , and it 's claimed to be the first flameless gadget of its kind .", 
        "its inventors , based in edmonton , canada , are raising money to put the lighter into production on kickstarter and have almost doubled their goal .", 
        "instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the illume arclighter creates a ` super high-intensity ' electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes .", 
        "flameless : instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the illume arclighter creates a ` super high-intensity ' electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes . its inventors say it lights in any direction and is rechargeable , among other qualities shown above .", 
        "safer ? instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the illume arclighter creates a ` super high-intensity ' electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes . this means there is no flare ups -lrb- pictured -rrb- like with matches or conventional lighters that can easily burn fingers .", 
        "illume arclighter replaces a traditional flame with a high intensity electric arc that focuses its energy at the tip .", 
        "it does n't need to be refilled with fuel but is instead powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery .", 
        "` simply place the illume arclighter on its dedicated usb powered charging dock and it will be ready for the next moment you need it , ' the company says .", 
        "` when electricity jumps between the two conducting electrodes at the tip of the lighter , it produces what is known as an electric arc .", 
        "` the air between these electrodes becomes ionised , creating the brilliant visual arc which produces the high heat . '", 
        "` when electricity jumps between the two conducting electrodes at the tip of the lighter , it produces what is known as an electric arc , ' the company explains .", 
        "` the air between these electrodes becomes ionised , creating the brilliant visual arc which produces the high heat . '", 
        "while the arc may be smaller than an open flame , it is much hotter , so it lights wicks more quickly and can be used from any angle .", 
        "the company says : ` unlike a regular lighter , there is no flame that can flare-up when positioned upside down .", 
        "` you can freely use the illume arclighter in any direction . even completely vertically . '", 
        "the lighter has flame-proof ceramic tips with a zinc alloy cover and a plastic body .", 
        "it focuses its heat at the tip so it wo n't leave sooty marks behind .", 
        "convenient : the device -lrb- pictured -rrb- has a built-in lithium ion battery and comes with a usb-powered dock -lrb- also shown -rrb- so it can be easily recharged . the lighter has flame-proof ceramic tips with a zinc alloy cover and a plastic body .", 
        "the device has a built-in lithium ion battery and comes with a usb-powered dock so it can be easily recharged .", 
        "the start-up shows the lighter being used to ignite candles , incense , gas stove tops and paper as long as the material fits between the electrodes .", 
        "the device costs cad$ 40 -lrb- \u00a3 21 or us$ 32 -rrb- via kickstarter including the charger and cable . it 's expected to ship in november .", 
        "durable : the device -lrb- pictured -rrb- , called the illume arclighter , contains a lithium-ion battery and can be recharged , meaning that users will never run out of fuel at a tricky moment again ."
