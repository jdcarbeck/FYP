        "what would you get if one of the queen 's corgis ran off with one of sir ranulph fiennes 's siberian huskies and had a puppy ? a corgski , of course , just like max .", 
        "at just 18.5 in from foot to shoulder , this diminutive fellow looks as if he was the runt of his litter . he is , in fact , a fully grown husky-corgi cross .", 
        "but , unbelievably , max has been abandoned and he 's looking for a home . he 's become a favourite with workers at the dogs trust in basildon , essex , who have been looking after him since he was found .", 
        "max -lrb- pictured -rrb- is a 18.5 in high fully-grown husky corgi cross . after being abandoned , he has now taken refuge at the dogs trust in basildon , essex .", 
        "huskies , such as the one pictured , have become increasingly popular due to shows such as game of thrones .", 
        "pictured is a typical welsh corgi . max is part corgi , part husky , and is looking for a new home .", 
        "` it quickly became apparent that he was the epitome of the saying good things come in small packages , ' says the trust 's sam davis .", 
        "` he caught the eye of our staff when he arrived , but as he was found as a stray , little is known about his life before . '", 
        "max is described as gentle , intelligent and big-hearted . there are currently 54 other wolf-like breeds being cared for by the charity 's network of animal rehousing centres .", 
        "the trust is in no doubt that the trend is partly due to fans wanting to follow the stars of game of thrones and twilight , which have popularised wolf-like dogs such as alaskan malamutes and siberian huskies .", 
        "but many new owners are often unprepared to cope with the specific exercise and socialisation requirements of these breeds -- and make a lifetime commitment to them -- resulting in a significant number eventually being abandoned ."
