        "the gadget is available to pre-order in nine countries .", 
        "the cheapest model is the 38 mm sport version and costs \u00a3 299 in the uk . in the us , the same model costs $ 349 , but this does n't include sales tax .",

        "the only places the watch works out cheaper in the uk is when it 's compared to the most expensive 42 mm edition model in australia and china , or the 38 mm edition in quebec and china .", 
        "explaining the price differences , apple told mailonline : ` uk prices include vat . us prices do n't include sales tax . '",
