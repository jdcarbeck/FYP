        "a handwritten notebook in which britain 's enigma machine genius alan turing admits he is baffled by an equation could fetch up to $ 1million -lrb- \u00a3 690,000 -rrb- . above , he wrote that the leibniz notation was ` extremely difficult '", 
        "it was written at the bletchley park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and paved the way for computer science . it is believed to be the only extensive turing manuscript known to exist , the auctioneer said .", 
        "benedict cumberbatch , who played turing in the oscar-nominated the imitation game , said : ` alan turing was a war hero , who broke the enigma code helping to bring an end to world war ii , the father of modern computing science , and a gay icon who lived in a time of intolerance and tragically committed suicide as a result .", 
        "` his impact on our everyday lives is enormous , and the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling . '", 
        "the notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician robin gandy .", 
        "turing -lrb- left -rrb- wrote the notes at the bletchley park code-breaking headquarters in 1942 and they paved the way for computer science . the notes are believed to be the only extensive turing manuscript -lrb- right -rrb- known to exist , the auctioneer said .", 
        "pages of notes show the inner workings of turing 's thoughts as he helped break codes and decipher tests .", 
        "the notes , which are highly personal , show turing working through different equations and considering different results .", 
        "gandy gave the papers to the archive centre at king 's college in cambridge in 1977 . but he kept the notebook , using its blank pages for writing down his dreams at the request of his psychiatrist .", 
        "bonham describes gandy 's entries as highly personal ; the notebook remained in his possession until he died in 1995 .", 
        "at the beginning of his journal , gandy writes : ` it seems a suitable disguise to write in between these notes of alan 's on notation , but possibly a little sinister ; a dead father figure , some of whose thoughts i most completely inherited . '", 
        "in a statement through bonhams , turing scholar andrew hodges said the notebook sheds more light on how turing ` remained committed to free-thinking work in pure mathematics . '", 
        "benedict cumberbatch , who played turing in the oscar-nominated the imitation game -lrb- left -rrb- , said : ` the thought of holding a manuscript by him is thrilling '", 
        "in some turing elaborates on his conclusions , writing that one result ` is too subtle and makes an inconvenient definition '", 
        "he added : ` alan turing was parsimonious with his words and everything from his pen has special value . '", 
        "turing committed suicide in 1954 . he was gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal in britain and was convicted of indecency in 1952 . he agreed to undergo hormone treatment as an alternative to imprisonment to ` cure ' his homosexuality .",
