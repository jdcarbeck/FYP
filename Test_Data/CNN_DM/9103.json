        "a warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into western europe 1.4 million years ago , a new study suggests .", 
        "researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors , the hominins , had been halted by colder and drier temperatures .", 
        "but as conditions warmed , they were able to branch out from africa into spain , and ultimately spread across europe .", 
        "spanish researchers say climate change impacted human migration . until 1.4 million years ago it was too cold to inhabit southeast spain . but then the climate warmed to 13 \u00b0c -lrb- 55 \u00b0f -rrb- and became more humid . this enabled hominins -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- - our distant ancestors - to move to new regions .", 
        "the research was led by dr jordi agusti from the catalan institution for research and advanced studies -lrb- icrea -rrb- .", 
        "published in the journal of human evolution , the paper suggests climate change affected the amount of resources available .", 
        "there have been various theories put forward over the years about the diet of our early ancestors , but a study from oxford university published last year claimed to have finally settled the debate .", 
        "an ancient human ancestor known as ` nutcracker man ' lived mainly on a diet of tiger nuts , worms and grasshoppers , according to research .", 
        "scientists believe this diet explains why the ancient hominin relative , called paranthropus boisei , which lived in east africa between 2.4 and 1.4 million years ago , had such distinctively powerful jaws and large , flat molar teeth .", 
        "the theory is based on analysis of the barranco le\u00f3n site in the guadix-baza basin in southeast spain .", 
        "here , simple oldowan tools have previously been found , linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago , reported popular archaeology .", 
        "but they were not able to migrate to this region until conditions improved .", 
        "the researchers said that the early pleistocene era -lrb- the era lasted from 2.59 million to 11,700 years ago -rrb- was characterised by colder and drier weather .", 
        "this ` possibly impeded the settlement of this region by the early hominin population from the southern caucasus , ' the researchers wrote .", 
        "but shortly afterwards , ` when the climatic conditions were again favourable , a hominin presence is suddenly evidenced . '", 
        "the theory is based on analysis of the barranco le\u00f3n site in the guadix-baza basin in southeast spain , shown by the grey marker on this map . here , simple oldowan tools have previously been found , linked to the earliest known hominins 1.4 million years ago .", 
        "the acheulean tool technology period - between 700,000 an 300,000 years ago - followed the more primitive oldowan period . tools at the time included large stone hand axes -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- made from flint and quartzite , used to scavenge from carcasses .", 
        "it should be noted that the warming climate referred to here is on a vastly longer time scale than modern climate change .", 
        "at the time 1.4 million years ago , though , temperatures warmed above 13 \u00b0c -lrb- 55 \u00b0f -rrb- and humidity increased , allowing hominins to inhabit the region - scavenging carcasses in the region with the help of tools .", 
        "` the data reported here clearly support the idea that the early hominin occupation of europe was strongly constrained by climatic and environmental conditions , rather than by physiography or cultural factors , ' the researchers wrote ."
