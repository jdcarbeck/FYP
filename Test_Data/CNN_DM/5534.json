        "you would be forgiven for thinking that the sun looked like a giant yolk after an amateur astronomer captured what looks like a chick sitting on its surface .", 
        "the strange formation was photographed by amateur astronomer gordon ewen , and is a sun spot . the phenomenon is fairly common and the number of spots on the solar surface reflects with how active the sun is .", 
        "they occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce , making a specific section of the sun stand out from its surroundings .", 
        "the sun 's having a yolk ! sun spots range hugely in size , from just 10 miles -lrb- 16 km -rrb- to 100,000 miles -lrb- 160,000 km -rrb- wide - big enough to be seen from earth without a telescope . each one can be more than ten times the size of our planet .", 
        "gordon ewen captured the festive photograph using a telescope at the bottom of his garden .", 
        "mr ewen , 57 , set up the observatory shed at the bottom of the garden in letchworth , hertfordshire , after he left his job five years ago .", 
        "` i 've been interested in astronomy since i was a child . i remember i used to love borrowing books about space from the library and i had telescope when i was 10 , ' he said .", 
        "` but it all took a backseat when i went to university to study chemistry though . '", 
        "the photograph of the chick-like sun spot was taken on march 10 at midday . the large telescope focuses on a specific wavelength of light and allows him to see the details created on the sun 's surface as hydrogen gas surfaces and swirls .", 
        "sun spots range in size , from just 10 miles -lrb- 16 km -rrb- to 100,000 miles -lrb- 160,000 km -rrb- wide - big enough to be seen from earth without a telescope , and more than ten times the size of our planet .", 
        "sunspots have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200 \u00b0c -lrb- 4,890 to 7,590 \u00b0f -rrb- , compared to 5,500 \u00b0c -lrb- 9,930 \u00b0f -rrb- for the surrounding solar material , which is why they are so visible . sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun , namely solar flares .", 
        "no , the picture on the left is not a sun spot ... : the photograph of the chick-like sunspot was taken using gordon ewen 's telescope that focuses on a specific wavelength of light . this allows him to see the details created on the sun 's surface -lrb- another example of his work pictured , right -rrb- .", 
        "mr ewen , 57 , set up the observatory -lrb- pictured -rrb- shed at the bottom of the garden in letchworth , hertfordshire , after he left his job five years ago . ` i 've been interested in astronomy since i was a child . i remember i used to love borrowing books about space from the library , ' he said .",

        "the hot spots are also the source of eruptions on the sun , mainly solar flares and coronal mass ejections -lrb- cmes -rrb- , all of which are linked to magnetic fields .", 
        "the sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle , which has an average duration of 11 years . this also affects the frequency of sunspots .", 
        "sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes , regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface .", 
        "sun spots are also the source of eruptions on the sun , mainly solar flares and coronal mass ejections -lrb- cmes -rrb- , all of which are linked to magnetic fields -lrb- a picture of a coronal mass ejection taken by mr ewen , pictured -rrb- ."
