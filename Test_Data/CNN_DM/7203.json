        "one problem with space travel is that humans are n't very good at coping with reduced gravity - their bones and muscles deteriorate over time .", 
        "but one company says they have an answer - a giant rotating space cylinder that can create artificial gravity .", 
        "scroll down for video .", 
        "a washington , dc-based company called united space structures wants to create a new space station . their giant cylinder -lrb- shown , with the iss and space shuttles illustrated -rrb- could apparently replace the iss . it would rotate four times per minute to create artificial gravity , and would be 1,300 ft -lrb- 400 metres -rrb- long , cost \u00a3 200 billion -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- and take 30 years to build .", 
        "the ` space mushroom ' was designed by bill kemp and ted maziejka from united space structures -lrb- uss -rrb- , based in washington , dc .", 
        "the final design would be 330ft -lrb- 100 metres -rrb- in diameter and 1,310 ft -lrb- 400 metres -rrb- long .",

        "artificial gravity is created by spinning the station 4.22 times per minute around its vertical axis , creating downward pressure via the centrifugal force to keep objects - including humans - on the floor .", 
        "the force would be the same as the gravity experienced on earth .", 
        "meanwhile on the iss , the station is in constant freefall towards earth as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in ` zero-gravity ' .", 
        "while the main cylindrical body would spin in one direction , the top dome-shaped section would spin in the other direction .", 
        "this would allow spacecraft to dock with the top of the station , which would appear stationary to them . the necessity for this dome gives the space station its mushroom-like appearance .", 
        "the dome would house the command centre for the station , and also many of the supplies needed for the crew on board .", 
        "` we believe artificial gravity is required to support long term living in space , ' mr kemp told mailonline .", 
        "to build the station , the team says they have ` patents pending ' for six robotic systems that can manufacture and construct a variety of structures in space .", 
        "while exact details are n't known at the moment , another company - tethers unlimited - has demonstrated how structures could be built in space with their spiderfab proposal , a system of robo-spiders that would build parts of spacecraft in orbit , although mr kemp told mailonline that the uss method would be ` different ' .", 
        "mr kemp added that , for this large structure , it would take about 30 years to build and cost close to \u00a3 200 billion -lrb- $ 300 billion -rrb- .", 
        "for comparison , it took more than 10 years to build the iss , at a cost of around \u00a3 67 million -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- - although this new station has 2.89 million times more volume .", 
        "and it would be ` large enough to transport all the people and equipment required to set up a colony on mars and would orbit mars and provide a safe environment while the mars base is being constructed . '", 
        "artificial gravity has been considered many times before , most famously in the ` stanford torus ' design -lrb- interior seen here -rrb- . a rotating station would allow people to live as if they were walking on earth , allowing them to stay in space for long periods of time .", 
        "to build the station , something like spiderfab -lrb- left -rrb- could be used , a proposed system of robo-spiders than can construct solar panels , trusses and other parts of spacecraft in orbit . on the right is an artificial gravity test nasa performed in september 1966 . the gemini 11 spacecraft was attached to an agena target vehicle and spun , with the astronauts reporting a small amount of artificial gravity in their spacecraft .", 
        "on the iss , the station is in constant freefall towards earth as it orbits the planet - so the astronauts live in ` zero-gravity ' . however , they actually still experience about 90 per cent of earth 's gravity , but the constant falling makes them seem weightless .", 
        "inside , the structures would be spinning so anyone on the curved ` floors ' around the edges would be pushed into the ground , simulating gravity on earth . but mr kemp said they want to build a smaller structure first , to prove the design works .", 
        "` our first structure will be 30 metres -lsb- 100ft -rsb- in diameter , it will create a 0.6 gravity environment and would house at least 30 people , ' he said .", 
        "this smaller structure would cost between \u00a3 3.5 and \u00a3 7 billion -lrb- $ 5 and $ 10 billion -rrb- , and could be built in the next 10 years . it would take just 12 to 18 months to build , according to mr kemp .", 
        "` the international space station is estimated to be decommissioned around 2024 , ' mr kemp noted .", 
        "the team has yet to begin any serious construction or testing as of yet - so at the moment , the station remains somewhat of a pipe dream .", 
        "astronauts on the iss -lrb- terry virts seen left , scott kelly on the right -rrb- live in a constant state of micro-gravity . mr kelly is spending a year on the iss to see what effects such conditions have on the human body for a prolonged period of time .", 
        "in the 1968 film 2001 : a space odyssey , astronauts are shown running around a spacecraft that spins -lrb- shown -rrb- while on a mission to deep space , creating artificial gravity for them to operate in .", 
        "previous concepts for spacecraft include this 1969 station that would rotate on its central axis to produce artificial gravity . the majority of early space station concepts created artificial gravity one way or another in order to simulate a more natural or familiar environment for the health of the astronauts on board .", 
        "however , space settlement expert al globus , who is also a contract scientist at nasa 's ames research centre , told mailonline that he thought the idea was somewhat sound - and artificial gravity was a necessity for prolonged stays in space .", 
        "` rotation to provide artificial gravity will counteract most , if not all , of the negative effects of micro-g , ' he said .", 
        "and he says if we truly want to live in space , including raising children there , it will be necessary to create such a station .", 
        "` there is no data on the effects of micro-g on kids , but it is safe to assume they will grow up very weak as muscles and bones develop in response to stress , ' he continued .", 
        "` thus , for settlement , there is simply no question that they must rotate and almost certainly need to provide 1g at least for the first few generations . '", 
        "but whether this station will be the answer remains to be seen .", 
        "several other proposals for a rotating space station have been drawn up - including a nasa concept called nautilus-x - but as of yet , there are no concrete plans by nasa , roscosmos -lrb- the russian space agency -rrb- or any other nation on what to do after the iss .", 
        "whether this station by united space structures or another concept will be built , remains to be seen .", 
        "nasa 's nautilus-x concept , shown , includes a doughtnut-shaped spinning section in the middle where astronauts can experience artificial gravity . the spacecraft is designed for long trips to the moon , mars or beyond .", 
        "while a spacecraft could be created with artificial gravity , astronauts will still have to contend with zero-gravity conditions if they ever venture outside into space . shown are nasa 's robert l. curbeam , jr. -lrb- left -rrb- and esa 's christer fuglesang above new zealand in 2006 ."
