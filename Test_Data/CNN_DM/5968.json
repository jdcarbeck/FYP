        "while this may seem extravagant , according to industry experts , a cinema room is now an ` expected ' luxury in properties worth over \u00a3 10million .", 
        "robert osborn , co-founding director of top luxury property developer consero london explained : ` home cinemas are a growing requirement , particularly for brand new or newly refurbished properties . '", 
        "` at the high level , media rooms are a valuable use of space and are expected , particularly in homes priced above \u00a3 10 million . we also often include pantries or bars as an addition to support the media room . '", 
        "as extravagant as it may seem , home cinemas are often a clever investment as they make use of low value space in the dark basement .", 
        "property insider , ben hubbard , an asset manager at oracleamg explains : ` cinemas are often situated in the basement of a dwelling because there is no need for natural light . '", 
        "ben estimates that cinemas can cost anything from a few thousand to \u00a3 100,000 to kit out and says : ` home cinemas can vary from a converted surplus bedroom within an average sized dwelling to a 30-seater theatre in the basement of a much larger home .", 
        "` there 's a vast difference in the set-up costs depending on how far you want to go , ' he said .", 
        "ben believes that the home cinema trend is growing , and having a dedicated cinema room is becoming ` important ' in high-end properties .", 
        "but does it ever reap financial rewards when it comes to selling ? ` if one was to spend fortunes investing in a cinema equipment for an average sized family home - the chances are it will not add any value to the house as a majority of the purchasers will have different uses for that room , ' ben said .", 
        "scroll down for video .",

        "this surrey screening room has velvet seats and inset lighting - perfect inspiration for the clooney in-house cinema complex .", 
        "` at the other end of the scale the more space the dwelling has the more likely you 're going to expect to see a cinema room and therefore the more value it will add . generally though it adds saleability factor rather than actual value .", 
        "` set-ups can range from large plasma tvs with off-the-shelf surround sound systems in a darkened rooms to tiered theatres with cinema quality digital projectors .", 
        "` high-end cinemas will have been constructed to consider the rest of the house and can be soundproofed to prevent noise problems occurring elsewhere , which also increases the cost . '", 
        "all apartments in the super-prime development in one hyde park have access to this amazing home cinema . a three-bedroom apartment is currently on the letting market with tunstall property at ... \u00a3 17,000 per week .", 
        "knowing how hard renovations can be we thought we 'd give the clooneys some inspiration on how to kit out their new entertainment room .", 
        "as these images show the home cinema is generally of a neutral hue with warm wood finishes to give it that authentic feel .", 
        "but it 's not only interior decisions george and amal will have to grapple with , questions involving audiophile speakers , sub woofers , heat management systems and aerospace grade mirrors -lrb- for the projector , not amal -rrb- will also have to be discussed at length .",
