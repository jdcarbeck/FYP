        "rarely can a headline in a matchday magazine have been so prophetic : on pages 16 and 17 of the united review , next to a picture of ander herrera , screamed the words ` right place , right time ' .", 
        "that has n't always been the case during the spaniard 's debut season at old trafford . between october 20 and february 17 , herrera was barely sighted and started just three of the 21 games manchester united played in that period , prompting much chatter about his place in the squad .", 
        "it is no secret david moyes wanted to bring herrera to old trafford on deadline day in august 2013 but red tape scuppered his ambitions ; united pressed ahead with transfer after moyes was jettisoned but his inactivity prompted questions : did louis van gaal want him or rate him ?", 
        "ander herrera , pictured with juan mata , netted a brace to ensure his side claimed the win against aston villa .", 
        "herrera has established himself in louis van gaal 's first team plans after missing out in previous months .", 
        "antonio valencia -lrb- right -rrb- congratulates two-goal hero herrera -lrb- centre -rrb- after the final whistle .", 
        "the settling in process was not easy but the 25-year-old 's head has never dropped and in the interview with the club publication , herrera made it clear that a lack of action was never going to leave him at loggerheads with van gaal .", 
        "` i am very happy , he said . ` even when i was n't playing , i was also happy . i am at manchester united . i feel really lucky to be here . we have to respect his decision . he wants the best for us , the team and we have to follow him always . '", 
        "herrera 's commitment was amply rewarded against aston villa . the brightest spark in a red jersey , he was certainly in the right place at the right time in the 43rd minute , when sweeping a terrific effort past brad guzan to set united on their way .", 
        "his passing was slick , his movement was clever and it was appropriate he bookended this victory with united 's third in injury time ; it was fifth shot on target in the barclays premier league and , amazingly , his fifth goal . no wonder he left with acclaim from his manager ringing in his ears .", 
        "` i knew ander has a touch of class , ' said van gaal . ` sometimes he was not composed at the right moment but now he has composure . scoring seven goals in a season when he has n't played so much ? i think that 's fantastic . '"
