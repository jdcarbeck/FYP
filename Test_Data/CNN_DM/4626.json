        "when waghorn , who played for millwall on loan from leicester in 2013 , lashed out after failing to win a corner on the hour , it was set up for the hosts to claim three precious points .", 
        "and they were duly delivered when jimmy abdou headed home harding 's cross with 15 minutes remaining , sending a febrile den into raptures .",

        "` jimmy abdou is a great fellow , a great servant to millwall fc , ' he said . ` if anyone deserved that goal for his performances since i took over . he has the ability to do that and i 've been telling him for seven years he can do that .",
