        "the sydney native , who also worked with new zealander jackson on the remake of `` king kong '' -lrb- 2005 -rrb- and `` the lovely bones '' -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , suffered a heart attack monday .", 
        "said a spokesman from the australian cinematographers society : `` we have been advised of the sudden death of andrew , '' adding that his family would provide an official statement later .", 
        "known for balancing technology with artistic considerations , lesnie also shot `` rise of the planet of the apes '' -lrb- 2011 -rrb- , directed by rupert wyatt .", 
        "the cinematographer recently polished off the water diviner , the directorial debut of russell crowe , another new zealand native . that movie opened friday in u.s. theaters .",

        "`` i 'd never worked with him or even met him before , but he 'd shot the babe films and i thought they looked amazing , the way he 'd used backlight and the sun and natural light to create a very magical effect , '' jackson said in a 2004 interview . `` and babe had that larger-than-life feel about it that i wanted .", 
        "`` so when we began looking for dps in early 1999 , i first decided to get either an australian or new zealand dp , as they 'd be used to the way we make films , '' jackson continued . `` every country is slightly different in that way , and i immediately thought of andrew . ''",
