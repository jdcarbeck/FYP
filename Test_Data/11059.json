        "tom ince chose not celebrate , nor did 60 or so travelling blackpool fans who used to cherish his displays . but derby county very much cheered this emphatic victory that solidified their position in the play-offs and provided a needed tonic after recent headaches .", 
        "ince 's reluctance to show joy when finding the net in some style against his former club was understandable . blackpool is where he crafted his game and made his name between 2011 and 2014 .", 
        "since he left last year , initially on loan to crystal palace in january , there has been only despair on the seaside , and this defeat confirmed they would take the championship wooden spoon .", 
        "derby celebrated an emphatic victory over blackpool that kept their promotion push going .", 
        "derby : grant , keogh , shotton , whitbread , warnock , bryson , hendrick -lrb- thomas 78 -rrb- , dawkins , ince -lrb- ward 74 -rrb- , bent -lrb- russell 68 -rrb- , lingard .", 
        "subs not used : christie , forsyth , roos , albentosa .",

        "derby , despite their recent troubles , can still look up . an easy win against the division 's worst team by far may not vouch for their play-off credentials but the three points help get them there .", 
        "steve mcclaren , who may be heading to the premier league no matter what , was unable to field top scorer chris martin because of a niggling hamstring injury .", 
        "but his absence was not crucial , this was over by half-time . probably after just 2 minutes 29 seconds . that is when craig bryson picked the ball up off jeff hendrick in the middle of the pitch , strolled forward unchallenged and let fly a shot from 20 yards that bounced into corner of the net .", 
        "deadlock broken , the rival fans united in trashing blackpool chairman karl oyston , whose stewardship has sent the club into league one .", 
        "` love blackpool hate oyston , ' was a banner held aloft in the sparsely-populated away end .", 
        "craig bryson celebrates after scoring the opening goal as early as the third minute .", 
        "tom ince scored derby 's second goal of the night against his former side at the ipro stadium .", 
        "chants were aired , ` oyston for forest ' being one of the more printable .", 
        "ince 's goal came in the 28th minute . he got the ball from ryan shotton , danced into the area and curled a wonderful effort inside the far post . how important his eight goals have been since joining on loan from hull .", 
        "ince stayed composed out of respect to the club where he scored 31 goals in 100 league games . some non-celebrations seem trivial . this , given all blackpool 's fans have suffered , was removing the salt from the wound .", 
        "a mere 58 seconds later , it was 3-0 .", 
        "straight from kick-off charles dunne sent a backpass into the path of darren bent , who finished cleanly . it meant he had scored in four consecutive league appearances for the first time since october 2009 .", 
        "he should have had a second seven minutes after the break . jesse lingard picked out ince , whose shot was saved by elliot parish , the ball rebounding back off ince to bent six yards out . but the former england striker ballooned his shot high over the bar .", 
        "he did double his tally in the 65th minute with a thumping penalty after peter clarke had fouled shotton . it was his 12th goal in 15 games since arriving on loan from aston villa .", 
        "derby will need more of the same to reach the premier league . for blackpool , that dream has long faded .", 
        "darren bent celebrates after added a third goal for derby inside the half-hour mark on tuesday .", 
        "bent rifles a penalty into the top corner in the second half to add derby 's fourth goal and his second .",
