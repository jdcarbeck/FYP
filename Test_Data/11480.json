        "many of us are very particular about how strong we like our tea and coffee and the same applies to how hot it has to be .", 
        "with this in mind , engineers have created a heated mug designed to keep the temperature ` just right ' from the first sip to the last drop .", 
        "called the nanoheat wireless heated mug , the $ 39.99 -lrb- \u00a3 26 -rrb- gadget can maintain the temperature at around 71 \u00b0c -lrb- 160 \u00b0f -rrb- for up to 45 minutes - giving you plenty of time to drink it all .",

        "it was designed by michigan-based design hmi and green lama , currently raising funds on kickstarter to fund production of the mug .", 
        "the team has raised more than $ 48,900 -lrb- \u00a3 32,330 -rrb- of its $ 120,000 -lrb- \u00a3 79,300 -rrb- goal so far and backers can pre-order the mug for $ 30 -lrb- \u00a3 20 -rrb- .",

        "the mug weighs a little over one pound -lrb- 454g -rrb- and can be used up to seven times before it needs to be recharged . a built-in timer automatically turns off the mug if its not used for 30 minutes , to conserve energy . the mug is only available in white , but wireless charging plates are available in both white and black .", 
        "` i have tried all different types of mugs , cups and warming plates but they were very inefficient , clumsy and a waste of money .", 
        "` so in late 2013 i started working on a wireless heated coffee mug with a rechargeable battery . '", 
        "the nanoheat wireless heated mug can be used up to seven times before it needs to be recharged and a built-in timer will automatically turn off the mug if its not used for 30 minutes to conserve energy .",
