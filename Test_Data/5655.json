        "forget the must-have wine cellar , hot-tub or \u00a3 1,700 italian coffee-maker -- the latest domestic fashion is for private home cinemas .", 
        "many of the super-rich are having them built -- complete with huge comfy seats and cup-holders , eardrum-blasting surround-sound systems , massive screens and even cocktail bars and popcorn-makers .", 
        "celebrities with a home cinema include the sherlock actor benedict cumberbatch , retail tycoon sir philip green and chelsea fc owner roman abramovich .", 
        "and this week we learnt that the beckhams want one , too .", 
        "forget the must-have wine cellar , hot-tub or \u00a3 1,700 italian coffee-maker -- the latest domestic fashion is for private home cinemas .", 
        "a planning application submitted for their 1860s home in london 's holland park shows drawings for a lower-groundfloor ` cinema room ' .", 
        "and the word ` cinema ' -- suggestive of a large scale -- is entirely appropriate . the ceiling height would be 9.5 ft , and the room measures some 300 sq ft -- just over twice the size of the average british living room .", 
        "that means the beckhams could easily fit 20 seats -- enough for their family of six plus friends -- in the room which would adjoin a 500 sq ft playroom .", 
        "in this ` beckham odeon ' , a projector and pull-down screen would be built into the ` non-historic ' ceiling .", 
        "having hired the ultra-swish interiors guru rose uniacke , one can safely assume it will be much classier than your local multiplex .", 
        "meanwhile , george clooney , who has recently purchased a \u00a3 10million manor house with his barrister wife amal on an island in the thames in sonning , berkshire , is also building a home cinema .", 
        "it will be in a new complex , set apart from the house , that includes a pool , a ` professional kitchen ' , a pergola and a bar .", 
        "draft layouts lodged with the local planning office reveal that the cinema will have 12 seats , behind which there will be an audio/video room which will house the banks of electronics required .", 
        "george clooney , who has recently purchased a \u00a3 10million manor house with his barrister wife amal -lrb- right -rrb- on an island in the thames in sonning , berkshire , is also building a home cinema .", 
        "and it is unlikely that hollywood celebrities such as clooney are waiting for films to come out on dvd -- no doubt eager publicists and production companies send george et al movies even before they are issued on general release .", 
        "not far from the beckhams in west london , pop star robbie williams lives in a 46-room house that was previously owned by the late film director michael winner .", 
        "a planning application submitted for david beckham 's -lrb- above -rrb- home earlier this week showed plans for a ` cinema room '", 
        "williams has sought planning permission to build an underground complex that features a pool and home cinema -lrb- although winner had already installed an impressive cinema with photos of his own movies on the walls -rrb- .", 
        "however , as well as these celebrities , russian oligarchs and retail tycoons , there is an increasing trend for normal families to install home cinemas .", 
        "magdalen rees , owner of chelsea connected , an audiovisual and internet installation firm , says : ` like swimming pools , home cinemas set the status of the house .", 
        "` many clients want the whole cinema experience , complete with banks of theatre-style seating . ' she says that one client had his own study-sized cinema built in his ` man cave ' -- complete with a solo cinema seat that was a present from his wife .", 
        "so , how much does a home cinema cost ?", 
        "` i 've installed all the technology -- projector , screen , amplifier , speakers and control unit -- for less than \u00a3 10,000 , ' says mrs rees .", 
        "` but the real expense is on the rest of the room -- the seating , decoration and lighting which automatically dims when the movie starts , giving that complete cinema feel . '", 
        "but with the average cost of a family visit to the cinema costing \u00a3 100 -lrb- including tickets , transport and food -rrb- , it almost starts to look like good value .", 
        "no matter your budget , it is possible to get something approaching the multi-millionaire home cinema experience .", 
        "if you have a spare room that you can dedicate , then so much the better -- but you do n't have to be a hollywood star to watch in film\u2011star style .", 
        "while the home cinemas found in celebrity homes might have popcorn makers , it is easy to make some yourself .", 
        "here are the best ways to get your home cinema up and running ...", 
        "under \u00a3 1,000 .", 
        "at this level , buying a projector is out of your league . your best bet is to shop around for a discounted 55in tv , such as the samsung ue55h6670 -- \u00a3 799 from currys .", 
        "to improve the sound quality , invest in a soundbar -- a slimline unit that houses lots of small speakers -- such as the yamaha yas103 , available from richer sounds for \u00a3 149 -lrb- richersounds.com -rrb- . this leaves you with \u00a3 52 to spare , which you may consider spending on six old cinema chairs currently available on ebay for \u00a3 48 .", 
        "with the remaining \u00a3 4 , you can buy four boxes of butterkist salted microwave popcorn , available from tesco for \u00a3 1 per box . installation can be done yourself .", 
        "sherlock actor benedict cumberbatch -lrb- above -rrb- also has a home cinema .", 
        "under \u00a3 5,000 .", 
        "although you can buy a decent projector for under this price , that will leave you with very little for speakers , seating and all those other extras .", 
        "it makes more sense to buy a 75in tv , such as the samsung ue75h6400 -- \u00a3 2,498.97 , also from currys .", 
        "this could then be combined with a soundbar , a subwoofer speaker that delivers thudding bass and two wireless surround-sound speakers . the best package for all this is the sonos playbar + sub + 2 x play : 1 , which costs \u00a3 1,534 -lrb- smarthomesounds.co.uk -rrb- .", 
        "with nearly \u00a3 1,000 left over , you can buy four lc7027 leather cinema chairs from amazon at \u00a3 219 each , and have enough to buy almost \u00a3 100 worth of snacks .", 
        "if you are handy with a power drill and have enough muscle around to lift up the tv set , installation can be diy .", 
        "over \u00a3 5,000 .", 
        "if you have a big budget , consider buying a projector . you can plug any media device into it , including a set-top box such as an apple tv , or a blu-ray or dvd player , or stream the internet . the epson eh-tw9200 costs \u00a3 2,799 and is almost as good as what you 'll get at the cinema .", 
        "do n't skimp on the screen or just project on to a white wall .", 
        "to get the best picture , look at the frontstage motorised home cinema projector screen hdtv , 197in x 147in , which is \u00a3 1,078 on amazon .", 
        "you will then need an amplifier , and at this level you should invest in anything that features dolby 's stunning new atmos technology for the most advanced surround-sound . try the denon avrx5200 networked 4k home cinema receiver at around \u00a3 1,329 .", 
        "buy a range of at least 11 speakers , including wall and ceiling units , as well as multiple subwoofers . aim to spend \u00a3 250 per speaker at the very least .", 
        "finally , invest in some premiere home cinema chairs from drinkstuff on ebay at \u00a3 1,299 each . these feature incliners , footrests and backrests , storage boxes , cup-coolers and even cup-warmers .", 
        "installation will have to be done by a professional , as projectors and screens need careful mounting ."
