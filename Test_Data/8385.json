        "welcome to the exoplanet hd 189733b , where temperatures reach 3,000 \u00b0c -lrb- 5,400 \u00b0f -rrb- and winds are in excess of 620mph -lrb- 1,000 km/h -rrb- .", 
        "this world might be 63 light-years away - and we ca n't even get a direct image of it - but scientists have incredibly been able to measure its atmosphere , just by measuring its sodium emission .", 
        "the findings - made with a relatively small telescope - suggest we may soon have the opportunity to examine other distant worlds beyond the solar system in unprecedented detail .", 
        "swiss researchers measured the temperature of ` hot jupiter ' hd 189733b . they found the temperature reaches up to 3,000 \u00b0c in the atmosphere -lrb- shown in diagram -rrb- . and wind speeds are in excess of 620 miles per hour . the findings were made using a novel technique relying on sodium signals .", 
        "the research was carried out by scientists from the universities of geneva and bern in switzerland .", 
        "hd 189733b is a gas-giant slightly larger than jupiter located 370 trillion miles -lrb- 600 trillion km -rrb- from earth - or 63 light-years .", 
        "it is located in the constellation vulpecula in the night sky - also known as the ` little fox ' .", 
        "the scientists found that the temperature on the planet increases dramatically with altitude -- up to 3,000 \u00b0c -lrb- 5,400 \u00b0f -rrb- in the upper atmosphere , hot enough to melt lead .", 
        "type : ` hot jupiter ' gas giant .", 
        "distance from earth : 63 light years .", 
        "temperature : up to 3,000 \u00b0c -lrb- 5,400 \u00b0f -rrb- .", 
        "wind speed : 620mph -lrb- 1,000 km/h -rrb- .", 
        "conditions : glass particles in the atmosphere give it its dazzling blue colour .", 
        "coupled with the extremely high wind speed of 620 mph -lrb- 1,000 km/h -rrb- , it reveals the planet has an extremely turbulent atmosphere - and is almost certainly inhospitable to life .", 
        "the planet was already known to orbit 13 times closer to its star that mercury is to our sun , completing an orbit in just 2.2 days .", 
        "but the results are exciting , because it highlights just how much information we can glean from a distant world with limited technologies .", 
        "speaking to mailonline , subproject leader dr kevin heng said it could be possible to measure the conditions on an earth-like world using this technique -- although the process was difficult .", 
        "` it remains to be seen if the astronomical community is able to do these measurements for earth analogues , ' he said .", 
        "the difficulty arises because an earth-sized world blocks out much less of the light of its parent star compared to a jupiter-sized world like hd 189733 b .", 
        "` it would help if we can find an earth-like exoplanet orbiting a really bright star , ' dr heng added .", 
        "and he said the research was important because they used a ` dinky four-metre telescope from the ground to do measurements of the quality as the hubble space telescope . '", 
        "hd 189733b -lrb- right -rrb- is a gas-giant slightly larger than jupiter -lrb- left -rrb- located 600 trillion kilometres from earth - or 63 light-years . it is located in the constellation vulpecula in the night sky - also known as the ` little fox '", 
        "the scientists found that the temperature on the planet -lrb- illustrated -rrb- increases dramatically with altitude -- up to 3,000 c in the upper atmosphere , hot enough to melt lead .", 
        "the technique works by measuring the ` sodium signal ' from distant worlds . when a planet passes in front of its star , the intensity of this signal varies .", 
        "depending on how weak or strong the signal is , it is possible to work out how hot the planet is .", 
        "and because the signals come from different altitudes , the scientists can measure the temperature difference across the atmosphere .", 
        "lower down on the planet , temperatures are believed to drop to a still-scorching 1,700 \u00b0c -lrb- 3,100 \u00b0f -rrb- .", 
        "to measure the wind , the team measured how the sodium lines were ` blueshifted ' - meaning its light was stretched in such a way to indicate it was coming towards us .", 
        "the planet -lrb- shown -rrb- was already known to orbit 13 times closer to its star that mercury is to our sun , completing an orbit in just 2.2 days . but the results are exciting , because it highlights just how much information we can glean from a distant world with limited technologies .", 
        "and this blueshift suggests winds are coming from a circulation process on the planet -- or , in other words , superfast winds .", 
        "comparable measurements of this planet have been made before , using large ground-based telescope -lrb- with mirrors up to 10 metres in size -rrb- and the hubble space telescope .", 
        "but this research used a comparatively small telescope , just 3.6 metres wide , at the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- in la silla , chile .", 
        "the research opens up the opportunity of studying atmospheres of distant exoplanets without having to resort to giant observatories or space telescopes ."
