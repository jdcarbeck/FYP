        "scientists who reviewed 20 different studies of penis size , including 15,521 measurements of penises from around the world found some surprising results .", 
        "since no other part of the human body is more shrouded in myth and folklore than men 's most precious part , it seemed the penis was the most deserving subject to study .", 
        "here 's what the latest research has to say : .", 
        "so , it is really six inches ?", 
        "a new paper in the british journal of urology international is based on the results of scientists who reviewed 20 different studies of penis size , including 15,521 measurements of penises from around the world .", 
        "most importantly , it was based only on studies where the penis had been measured by a trained health professional -lrb- surprise , surprise : men are n't terribly honest or accurate when they measure it themselves -rrb- .", 
        "the result : most men fall within just a couple of centimetres of each other , with most measuring around 5.2 inches in length when erect with a 4.6 inch circumference .", 
        "if he wants to diy , the correct way to measure a penis is to use a cloth measuring tape , not a straight-edged ruler . he should measure while it 's erect and measure the side facing his stomach , pushing the tape down to press against the pubic bone -lrb- so he 's not measuring fat ! -rrb- .",

        "two reputable online surveys found no link between the use of pornography and erection problems , despite popular perception that watching too much porn leads to ed -lrb- erectile dysfunction -rrb- .", 
        "what does make sense -lrb- though , again not proven -rrb- is that men who have difficulties turn to porn as a way of experiencing sex without embarrassment .",

        "this may well have legs . the myth says bald men are more virile than men with hair because they have more testosterone in their body -lrb- which can cause hair loss -rrb- . the testosterone/hair loss link is proven . baldness is caused when hair follicles become exposed to too much dihydrotestosterone -lrb- dht -rrb- which is a chemical produced by the male hormone testosterone . testosterone is also the chemical responsible for his libido .", 
        "the average number of erections per day for most men is seven . but five of these occur while he 's asleep .", 
        "the penis has a safety-valve that ensures a man ca n't ejaculate and urinate at the same time .",
