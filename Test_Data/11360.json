        "as our cities get busier parking spaces become harder to come by and it can be difficult to squeeze into a tight spot in rush hour .", 
        "but german engineers have come up with an innovative solution - a small electric car that can turn on the spot , shrink in size and even move sideways , like a crab , so it can park itself .", 
        "the eossc2 is described as an ` ultra flexible micro-car for mega cities ' and is designed to connect to others to form a train .",

        "engineers at the dfki robotics centre describe the eossc2 -lrb- animated -rrb- as an ` ultra flexible micro-car for mega cities ' and plan on enabling it to drive itself . the concept car can turn on the spot , shrink in size and even move sideways , like a crab , so it can park itself .", 
        "crabs have a wide flat body to make it easier squeeze into narrow spaces and the eossc2 works in a similar way .", 
        "the arthropods flex the second joint of each leg to move sideways , although some crabs can walk forwards as well .", 
        "in the case of the eossc2 , the car turns its wheels to manoeuvre and mimic this movement .", 
        "its unusual design also features a forward tilt and doors that open like the delorean in back to the future .", 
        "its unusual design also features a forward tilt and doors that open like the delorean in back to the future -lrb- pictured -rrb- . currently , the two-seater vehicle can be driven in the traditional way , diagonally and sideways . it pivots using wheels powered by separate motors and shrinks from 8ft -lrb- 2.5 metres -rrb- to 5ft ft -lrb- 1.5 metres -rrb- .", 
        "crabs -lrb- stock image -rrb- have a wide flat body to make it easier squeeze into narrow spaces and the eossc2 works in a similar way . the arthropods flex the second joint of each leg to move sideways , although some crabs can walk forwards as well . in the case of the car , the wheels pivot sideways .", 
        "created at the dfki robotics centre in bremen , germany , the concept vehicle is intended to be semi-autonomous .", 
        "the car 's computer and its auto-navigation system enables it to park itself , ` even within narrow and congested roads , ' the firm said .", 
        "size : 8 feet -lrb- 2.5 metres -rrb- to 5 feet -lrb- 1.5 metres -rrb- .",

        "motors : four 4kw wheelhub motors .", 
        "sensors : 360 lidar sensor on the roof .", 
        "testing : bremen , germany and dalian , china .", 
        "` later , an autopilot will be able to drive the car without a single passenger intervention creating the driverless car , ' it added .", 
        "currently , the two-seater vehicle can be driven in the traditional way , diagonally and sideways .", 
        "it can also pivot on the spot and shrink from 8 feet -lrb- 2.5 metres -rrb- to 5 feet -lrb- 1.5 metres -rrb- while maintaining a comfortable seating position , according to the firm .", 
        "it does this because its wheels are individually powered by separate motors so they can turn in different directions .", 
        "the car has a top speed of 40mph -lrb- 65 km/h -rrb- and its semi-autonomous features are possible because of inbuilt cameras and a lidar sensor on its roof , which lets the vehicle scan its environment and locate itself in it , 10 times a second .", 
        "it is designed to link with others to from a kind a connected convoy that can save energy over long distances - such as on motorways or as a car-sharing scheme .",
