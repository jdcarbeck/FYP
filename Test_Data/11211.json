        "the skull of a 66-million-year old triceratops is expected to raise almost $ 2 million at auction .", 
        "known as lung wong , or the dragon king , the fossilised item is said to be the world 's largest intact dinosaur skull , measuring 9.2 ft -lrb- 2.8 metres -rrb- long .", 
        "the auction is open now and the fossil is being sold by hong kong-based experts at evolved .", 
        "the dragon king dinosaur skull -lrb- pictured -rrb- is being sold by hong kong-based experts evolve . it is more than 95 per cent complete bone , is 9.2 ft -lrb- 2.8 metres -rrb- long , 5.2 ft -lrb- 1.6 metres -rrb- high and 4.6 ft -lrb- 1.4 metres -rrb- wide which is said to make it the world 's largest example of such an item .", 
        "the last time something of this size and quality came to market was when a tyrannosaurus rex fossil named ` sue ' was sold for \u00a3 5.6 million -lrb- $ 8.5 million -rrb- in 1997 .", 
        "the rare lung wong fossil was first discovered in 1992 when rancher ray novakovich in glendive , montana reportedly found the tip of one of the dinosaur 's horns .", 
        "owing to its size and a lack of resources , though , it was n't excavated until 2003 - and since then is said to have changed hands a number of times .", 
        "it has also been restored and preserved into its current condition .", 
        "the skull is more than 95 per cent complete bone , is 9.2 ft -lrb- 2.8 metres -rrb- long , 5.2 ft -lrb- 1.6 metres -rrb- high and 4.6 ft -lrb- 1.4 metres -rrb- wide .", 
        "the skull belonged to a male triceratops that lived 66 million years ago . the fossil - first found in montana in 1992 - is expected to fetch $ 1.8 million -lrb- \u00a3 1.2 million -rrb- at auction . however , the experts have not revealed when the auction closes and mailonline has contacted it for more information .", 
        "in a statement from sellers evolved , the firm said that a fossil ` of this magnitude and quality is only very rarely available for private sale anywhere , and never before in asia ' . the largest previously recorded triceratops skull measured 8.2 ft -lrb- 2.5 metres -rrb- long but the creatures ' skulls were said to average at 7ft -lrb- 2 metres -rrb- .", 
        "in a statement released by evolved , the firm said that a fossil ` of this magnitude and quality is only very rarely available for private sale anywhere , and never before in asia . '", 
        "however , the experts have not revealed when the auction closes and mailonline has contacted it for more information .", 
        "the name of the fossil is inspired by the symbol of ` strength , good fortune and longevity ' in chinese culture - the dragon . the size of the skull apparently also suggests it might be an entirely new species .", 
        "the largest previously recorded triceratops skull measured 8.2 ft -lrb- 2.5 metres -rrb- long , but the creatures ' skulls were said to average at around 7ft -lrb- 2 metres -rrb- .", 
        "` if this -lsb- theory -rsb- is confirmed , the owner will be entitled to name the species for posterity , ' the group selling the skull added on its official website .", 
        "however , some experts have bemoaned selling such a prized fossil to a private benefactor , rather than placing it in a museum .", 
        "` commercially sold fossils kept in private collections can not be studied by paleontologists because they can only publish research on fossils stored in museums or similar institutions , ' said dr. michael pittman , a research assistant professor at the university of hong kong , reported shanghaiist .", 
        "this dinosaur lived in the late cretaceous period , from about 68 to 66 million years ago , in what is now north america .", 
        "it is known for its three recognisable horns , the two largest being 3.3 ft -lrb- one metre -rrb- long and a shorter one on its nose , with its name translating as ` three-horned face ' from greek .", 
        "it is thought to have shared its landscape with the tyrannosaurus rex , and may have also been preyed upon by the fearsome predator .", 
        "triceratops were herbivorous , with low growth being their food of choice owing to their low heard .", 
        "the exact purpose for its horns is not fully understood , though .", 
        "the favoured theory is that they may have been used for courting , although combat was also a possibility .", 
        "the creature was rather large , reaching up to 29ft -lrb- nine metres -rrb- in length and 10ft -lrb- three metres -rrb- in height , and it weighed up to 26,000 lbs -lrb- 12 tonnes -rrb- .", 
        "it is believed to have been wiped out in the cretaceous-paleogene -lrb- k-pg -rrb- extinction event 66 million years ago ."
