        "as the weather gets warmer many of us will dust off our large and cumbersome bladed fans .", 
        "but panasonic has developed a lighter , smaller and more powerful alternative that can blow out seven times more air than it sucks in .", 
        "the sokaze-ki q uses fluid dynamics to take air in at the rear of the 10-inch -lrb- 25 cm -rrb- device , move it through specially designed channels before blasting it from the front via a turbofan .", 
        "panasonic japan , which designed the device , said that once the turbofan has moved the air flow to the front of the device , a ` high-pressure jet airflow ' creates straight , direct blasts of air . alternatively , the q has a ' 1/f fluctuation ' function that reduces the force of the air flow , and sends ` natural wind ' that mimics outside breeze .", 
        "these channels have been designed to reduce how much drag the air flow is subjected to as it moves through the ` ball ' .", 
        "and the holes have been designed in such a way so that the flow collects additional air at is leaves the device to boost its trajectory and output .", 
        "in particular , there is a central outlet . air is drawn into the ` q ' using small inlets on the rear and are driven by the so-called impellers , or bladed fins .", 
        "this airflow pulls in additional air using the large round air inlets plotted around the q , and all of this is released through the main outlet .", 
        "the sokaze-ki q -lrb- pictured -rrb- uses fluid dynamics to take air in small inlets on the rear before it is moved using so-called impellers through specially designed channels . this airflow pulls in additional air from air inlets plotted around the q , and all of this is released through the main outlet .", 
        "the fan is on sale in japan for \u00a5 39,350 -lrb- \u00a3 220 -rrb- and is available in crystal red , champagne gold -lrb- pictured -rrb- and pearl white . it is powered by a dc motor and comes with an off timer for between one and three hours .", 
        "panasonic japan , which designed the device , said that once the turbofan has moved the air flow to the front of the device , a ` high-pressure jet airflow ' creates straight , direct blasts of air .", 
        "alternatively , the q has a ' 1/f fluctuation ' function that reduces the force of the air flow , instead sending ` natural , fluctuating wind ' that mimics the outside breeze .", 
        "` everything is up to you , ' as the firm explained .", 
        "` it can be used as circulator . or as a fan . we will deliver the combined wind in your life . '", 
        "the q fan has a diameter of 10 inches -lrb- 25 cm -rrb- , is 11 inches tall -lrb- 27 cm -rrb- and weighs 4.6 lbs -lrb- 2.1 kg -rrb- .",
