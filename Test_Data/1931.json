        "tsarnaev 's conviction was widely expected , given his lawyer 's startling admission during opening statements that he took part in the bombing . but the lawyer also argued that tsarnaev 's older brother , tamerlan , masterminded the attack and enlisted his then-19-year-old brother to help .",
