      <text bytes="4228" xml:space="preserve">The '''Huston Plan''' was a 43-page report and outline of proposed security operations put together by [[White House]] aide [[Tom Charles Huston]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture30.html America Sinking through a Watergate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220091431/http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/lectures/lecture30.html |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It first came to light during the 1973 [[Watergate]] hearings headed by Senator [[Sam Ervin]] (a Democrat from North Carolina).
       
The impetus for this report stemmed from President [[Richard Nixon]] wanting more coordination of domestic intelligence in the area of gathering information about purported '[[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] radicals' and the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture-era]] [[Peace movement|anti-war movement]] in general. Huston had been assigned as White House liaison to the Interagency Committee on Intelligence (ICI), a group chaired by [[J. Edgar Hoover]], then [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Director. Huston worked closely with [[William C. Sullivan]], Hoover's assistant,  in drawing up the options listed in what eventually became the document known as the Huston Plan.
     
Among other things the plan called for domestic [[burglary]], illegal electronic [[surveillance]] and opening the mail of domestic "radicals". At one time it also called for the creation of camps in Western states where anti-war protesters would be detained.
          
In mid-July 1970 Nixon ratified the proposals and they were submitted as a document to the directors of the FBI, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) and the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA).
        
Out of these only Hoover objected to the plan, and gained the support of then [[Attorney General of the United States]] [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] to pressure Nixon to rescind the plan.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Theodore H.|title=Breach of faith; the fall of Richard Nixon|date=1975|publisher=Dell|isbn=9781501142734|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; And despite the ultimate decision by the President to revoke the Huston Plan, several of its provisions were implemented anyway.

After the Huston Plan, the FBI lowered the age of campus informants, thereby expanding surveillance of American college students as sought through the Plan. In 1971, the FBI reinstated its use of [[mail cover]]s and continued to submit names to the CIA mail program.

As details of the Huston Plan unfolded during the Watergate Hearings, it came to be seen as a part and parcel of what Attorney General Mitchell referred to as "[[White House horrors]]". This would include the [[White House Plumbers|Plumbers Unit]], the proposed fire-bombing of the [[Brookings Institution]], the 1971 burglary of the office of the psychiatrist of [[Daniel Ellsberg]], the creation of a White House enemies list, and the use of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to punish those deemed to be enemies. 
        
The Huston Plan was also investigated by the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]], chaired by [[Frank Church|Senator Frank Church]] in 1976, into activities of the CIA and abuses of domestic intelligence gathering.

==In popular culture==

The Huston Plan appears (and is explained in on-screen text) in a comedy sketch on the sixteenth episode of the second season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

      <text bytes="4624" xml:space="preserve">A '''limited hangout''' or '''partial hangout''' is, according to former special assistant to the [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[Victor Marchetti]], "spy jargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clandestine professionals. When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting—sometimes even volunteering—some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and damaging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further."&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Marchetti]] (August 14, 1978) ''[[The Spotlight]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/720/f2d/631 |title=720 F2d 631 Hunt v.

In a March 22, 1973 meeting between president [[Richard Nixon]], [[John Dean]], [[John Ehrlichman]], [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], and [[H. R. Haldeman|H.&amp;nbsp;R. Haldeman]], Ehrlichman incorporated the term into a new and related one, "'''modified limited hangout'''".&lt;ref&gt;Frost/Nixon: The Complete Interviews. David Frost, Richard Nixon. Paradine Television, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Safire|first=William|title=On Language; In Nine Little Words|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/26/magazine/on-language-in-nine-little-words.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=23 June 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phrase was coined in the following exchange:&lt;ref name="Transcript"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpol.org/transcript.php?id=130|title=Transcript of a recording of a meeting among the president, John Dean, John Erlichman, H.&amp;nbsp;R. Haldeman, and John Mitchell on March 22, 1973 from 1:57 to 3:43 p.m.|publisher=History and Politics Out Loud|accessdate=2006-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Pull quote|PRESIDENT: You think, you think we want to, want to go this route now? And the&amp;nbsp;— let it hang out, so to speak?&lt;br /&gt;
DEAN: Well, it's, it isn't really that&amp;nbsp;—&lt;br /&gt;
HALDEMAN: It's a limited hang out.&lt;br /&gt;
DEAN: It's a limited hang out.&lt;br /&gt;
EHRLICHMAN: It's a modified limited hang out.&lt;br /&gt;
PRESIDENT: Well, it's only the questions of the thing hanging out publicly or privately.}}

Before this exchange, the discussion captures Nixon outlining to Dean the content of a report that Dean would create, laying out a misleading view of the role of the White House staff in events surrounding the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate burglary]]. In Ehrlichman's words: "And the report says, 'Nobody was involved,'". The document would then be shared with the [[United States Senate Watergate Committee]] investigating the  affair. The report would serve the administration's goals by protecting the President, providing documentary support for his false statements should information come to light that contradicted his stated position. Further, the group discusses having information on the report leaked by those on the Committee sympathetic to the President, to put exculpatory information into the public sphere.&lt;ref name="Transcript" /&gt;

The phrase has been cited as a summation of the strategy of mixing partial admissions with [[misinformation]] and resistance to further investigation, and is used in political commentary to accuse people or groups of following a Nixon-like strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/05/01/DD150649.DTL|title=The Richard Nixon playbook|first=Jon|last=Carrol|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=2006-08-27|date=2002-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Sandwedge''' was a proposed clandestine intelligence-gathering operation against the political enemies of the [[Richard Nixon]] presidential administration. The proposals were put together by [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[John Ehrlichman]] and [[Jack Caulfield]] in 1971. Caulfield, a former police officer, created a plan to target the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], inspired by what he believed to be the Democratic Party's employment of a private investigation firm.

The operation was planned to help Nixon's [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 re-election campaign]]. Operation Sandwedge included proposed surveillance of Nixon's enemies to gather information on their financial status and sexual activities, to be carried out through illegal [[black bag operation]]s.

Control of Sandwedge was passed to [[G. Gordon Liddy]], who abandoned it in favor of a strategy of his own devising, [[Operation Gemstone]], which detailed a plan to [[Watergate burglaries|break into Democratic Party offices]] in the [[Watergate complex]]. Liddy's plan eventually led to the [[Watergate scandal|downfall of Nixon's presidency]], which Caulfield believed would have been avoided had Sandwedge been acted upon.

==Background==
{{Watergate|Events}}
In 1968, [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|United States Republican Party]] nominee, won the [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential election]], defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] by seven-tenths of a percent of the popular vote.&lt;ref name="election68"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1968 |title=U.S. Electoral College: Historical Election Results 1789–1996 |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Black|2007|p=558}} Nixon appointed [[H. R. Haldeman]] as his [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]]; this position granted Haldeman a relatively large degree of control over the activities of the presidential administration.{{sfn|Genovese|2009|p=86}} Haldeman had first worked for Nixon in 1956, during Nixon's successful bid for the vice-presidency under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name="brush obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/13/obituaries/h-r-haldeman-nixon-aide-who-had-central-role-in-watergate-is-dead-at-67.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=H. R. Haldeman, Nixon Aide Who Had Central Role in Watergate, Is Dead at 67 |first=Richard |last=Severo |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 13, 1993 |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1971, Nixon's staff were receiving a cursory intelligence report from Haldeman's assistant, [[Gordon C. Strachan]]; Strachan's reports essentially collated information about political rallies and campaign groups that had already been gathered by the police and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=72}} Prior to this, Nixon's initial election bid had already involved the planting of rumors and false information about his opponents as a dedicated strategy; these tactics had been dubbed "political hardball" by Nixon's [[opposition researcher]] [[Pat Buchanan]].{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=72}} In August 1971, Strachan had convinced [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]], a member of the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP)—the campaign group for Nixon's re-election bid—to infiltrate the office of [[Edmund Muskie]]. Muskie was a Democratic senator who had been Humphrey's 1968 vice-presidential candidate, and was a front-runner for his party's presidential bid for the 1972 campaign.{{sfn|Dean|1977|pp=72–73}}

==Inception==

In late 1971, [[John Dean]], the [[White House Counsel]], pushed to expand the existing intelligence program ahead of the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 re-election campaign]]. Dean delegated the task to [[Jack Caulfield]], a member of his staff who was a former [[New York City Police Department|New York police officer]]. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector.{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=73}}&lt;ref name="ownwords"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watergate.com/ownwords/caulfield.asp |title=Watergate.com's Nixon Era Times: In Their Own Words -- Jack Caulfield |first=Jack |last=Caulfield |publisher=[[Mountain State University]] |accessdate=October 17, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405234928/http://www.watergate.com/ownwords/caulfield.asp |archivedate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Emery, a journalist for ''[[The Times]]'' and [[BBC]], refutes this, claiming in his book ''Watergate: The Corruption &amp; Fall of Richard Nixon'' that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=74}}

[[John Ehrlichman]], a long-time friend of Haldeman,&lt;ref name="brush obit"/&gt; who had also served as White House Counsel, had been part of the operation's inception; at this time he was Nixon's domestic affairs assistant.{{sfn|Warshaw|2013|p=274}}&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; Ehrlichman was the one who had initially hired Caulfield in 1969; Ehrlichman intended for Caulfield to conduct private investigation while undercover as a private sector employee, it was Caulfield who insisted on working from the White House.{{sfn|Emery|1994|pp=74–75}} Caulfield's work to this end had already resulted in two wiretaps on phone lines—one on Nixon's brother [[Donald Nixon|Donald]], and another on journalist [[Joseph Kraft]].{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=75}}

Caulfield prepared a twelve-page draft proposal detailing an intelligence-gathering strategy, aimed at the opposition Democratic Party; he had worked on this draft for several months and presented it to Nixon's staff in September 1971.{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=74}} The proposal, dubbed "Operation Sandwedge",{{refn|Dean attributes the name to Caulfield's enthusiasm for golf, noting that a [[sand wedge]] club is used to recover a ball from precarious ground.{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=74}}|group="nb"}} called for a budget of $500,000, primarily to cover private investigative work and security for the [[Republican National Convention]], however Caulfield intimated privately that it would also include electronic surveillance.{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=74}}

==Planned activities==

The investigations and surveillance would, in part, assess how the [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]] could damage Nixon's campaign. Nixon's staff also anticipated that the Democratic campaign would employ the services of Intertel, a [[Private investigator|private investigation]] firm led by former [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] officials who had served under [[Robert F. Kennedy]], a Democrat and former [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. Caulfield noted that this firm had the potential to employ "formidable and sophisticated" intelligence-gathering techniques, and Sandwedge was his attempt to create a Republican counterpart to it.&lt;ref name="ownwords"/&gt; The plan would involve [[black bag operation]]s, targeting political enemies of the campaign.{{sfn|Genovese|1999|p=27}} Electronic surveillance was also an element of the proposal, with plans to scrutinize the private lives of the targets, including their tax records and sexual habits.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/9393218/Jack-Caulfield.html |title=Jack Caulfield |date=July 11, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sandwedge proposal also included a list of people willing to work with Caulfield on the project; these included several investigators and officials of [[Inland Revenue]], and a former sheriff of [[Cook County, Illinois]].{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=74}}

[[Herb Kalmbach]], Nixon's own attorney, transferred $50,000 to Caulfield at the request of [[John N. Mitchell]].{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=77}} Mitchell had served as [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] under Nixon's first term, and directed the 1972 re-election campaign.&lt;ref name="mitchell"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/stories/mitchobit.htm |title=John N. Mitchell, Principal in Watergate, Dies at 75| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Lawrence |last=Meyer | date=November 10, 1988 | accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caulfield was also given responsibility for the salary of Tony Ulasewicz, an operative he planned to use for Sandwedge activities.{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=77}} However, Strachan, Dean and other staff members were frustrated at the pace of Caulfield's development of the project. Strachan directly questioned whether Caulfield was adequately capable for the role in a memo dated from October 1971, while Haldeman, wishing for a project on a larger scale, pressed Mitchell for a budget of $800,000 for surveillance and "miscellaneous" activities.{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=77}}

During this time, Caulfield recruited [[James W. McCord, Jr.]], a retired [[CIA]] officer, to protect the offices of the Republican National Convention and the CRP from electronic bugging. McCord would later be directly employed by CRP from January 1972. Caulfield also sent Ulasewicz to the campaign offices of [[Pete McCloskey|Paul McCloskey]] in New Hampshire. McCloskey was a Republican congressman for California, who was running for the party's presidential nomination against Nixon on a platform opposing the Vietnam War. He was not regarded as a credible threat to Nixon's campaign, but had made statements calling for Nixon to be impeached. In December 1971, Ulasewicz masqueraded as a journalist to interview McCloskey's staff, with Caulfield dubbing the effort a "Sandwedge-engineered penetration".{{sfn|Emery|1994|=78}}

==Cancellation==

That October, a meeting concerning Sandwedge was arranged between Haldeman, Mitchell, Magruder and Strachan.{{sfn|Impeachment|1998|p=57}}{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=75}} As a result of this meeting, control of the operation was passed along to [[G. Gordon Liddy]], because Mitchell wished to have a lawyer in charge of the campaign's intelligence-gathering.&lt;ref name="ownwords"/&gt; Another factor in Caulfield's removal from the helm was the belief of several White House officials, including Dean, that Caulfield's Irish-American, non-college educated background was at odds with "an Administration of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] professional men".{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=74}}

Liddy built upon the proposals to devise "[[Operation Gemstone]]", a more expansive plan of espionage. Gemstone was an umbrella term for several individual operations, each of which expanded upon elements of the Sandwedge draft or existing CRP activities—Operation Diamond covered breaking up protest demonstrations, Ruby involved undercover infiltration and [[honeypot (espionage)|honeypot traps]], Crystal concerned electronic surveillance and wiretaps, and Sapphire proposed the sabotage of rival political campaigns.{{sfn|Dean|1977|pp=81–84}} Liddy's initial draft of Operation Gemstone was deemed "too extreme" by campaign officials, but a scaled-down version was later approved in 1972.{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=725}} Despite Liddy's restructuring of the project, a request for additional funding for the original Sandwedge proposal was made by Dean in January 1972, although Mitchell's rejection of this request signalled the project's end.{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=78}}

Liddy's revised Gemstone plan included a range of illegal activities, including a proposal to [[Watergate burglaries|break into Democratic Party offices]] in the [[Watergate complex]].{{sfn|Knight|2003|p=725}} The Watergate burglaries were initially assumed to have been part of Operation Sandwedge, and the investigation into both the burglaries and the project led to Caulfield's resignation from his Nixon-appointed position as assistant director of criminal enforcement in the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]], 69 people were tried for various crimes, with 48 of these pleading guilty. Among those found guilty for covering up the affair were Haldeman, Ehrlichmann, Mitchell, Dean and Magruder, while Liddy was found guilty for his role in the break-ins. All 48 men served time in prison as a result of their convictions.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E7DF1F3FF933A05753C1A9639C8B63 |title=Ideas and Trends; When Criminal Charges Reach the White House |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Bill |last=Marsh |date=October 30, 2005 |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caulfield has suggested that Sandwedge's cancellation by the administration was an error in judgement, possibly "the most monumental of the Nixon Presidency". He believed that, if had Sandwedge been adopted as the campaign's strategy, "there would have been no Liddy, no [[E. Howard Hunt|Hunt]], no [[James W. McCord, Jr.|McCord]]", and the subsequent Watergate scandal would not have occurred.&lt;ref name="ownwords"/&gt; Speaking of the initial proposal, Dean defended its merits, stating that "Caulfield, not the plan itself, had killed Sandwedge".{{sfn|Dean|1977|p=77}}

{{Watergate|Events}}
The '''Saturday Night Massacre''' is the name popularly applied&lt;ref&gt;https://www.history.com/news/what-was-the-saturday-night-massacre&lt;/ref&gt; to the series of events that took place in the United States on the evening of Saturday, October 20, 1973, during the [[Watergate scandal]]. [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] ordered [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Elliot Richardson]] to fire [[Special Prosecutor]] [[Archibald Cox]]; Richardson refused and resigned effective immediately. Nixon then ordered [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[William Ruckelshaus]] to fire Cox; Ruckelshaus refused, and also resigned. Nixon then ordered the third-most-senior official at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Robert Bork]], to fire Cox. Bork considered resigning, but instead carried out the dismissal as Nixon asked. 

The political and public reactions to Nixon's actions were negative and highly damaging to the president. The [[impeachment process against Richard Nixon]] began 10 days later, on October 30, 1973. New Special Prosecutor [[Leon Jaworski]] was appointed on November 1, 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&amp;dat=19731101&amp;id=q00iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k6wFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2082,4677|title=Attorney General, Prosecutor Picked|work=[[The Argus-Press]]|date=November 1, 1973|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on November 14, 1973, United States District Judge [[Gerhard Gesell]] ruled that the dismissal had been illegal.&lt;ref name= noble/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ralph Nader|Nader]] v. Bork'', 366 F. Supp. 104 (D.D.C. 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson had appointed Cox in May 1973 after promising the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] that he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the events surrounding the break-in of the Democratic National Committee's offices at the [[Watergate Hotel]] in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972. The appointment was created as a career reserved position in the Justice department, meaning it came under the authority of the attorney general who could only remove the special prosecutor "for cause", e.g., gross improprieties or malfeasance in office. Richardson had, in his confirmation hearings before the U.S. Senate, promised not to use his authority to dismiss the Watergate special prosecutor, unless for cause.&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;{{cite AV media|date=1994 |title=Watergate|volume=Volume 2: The Conspiracy Crumbles. Episode 4: Massacre|publisher=Discovery Channel|oclc=37028979|medium=VHS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Cox issued a [[subpoena]] to Nixon, asking for copies of [[Nixon White House tapes|taped conversations]] recorded in the [[Oval Office]], the president refused to comply. On Friday, October 19, 1973, Nixon offered what was later known as the [[Stennis Compromise]]&amp;nbsp;– asking the infamously [[deaf|hard-of-hearing]] Senator [[John C. Stennis]] of [[Mississippi]] to review and summarize the tapes for the special prosecutor's office. Cox refused the compromise that same evening, and it was believed that there would be a short rest in the legal maneuvering while government offices were closed for the weekend.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt;

[[File:Archibald Cox 04989v.jpg|thumb|right|[[Archibald Cox]]]]
However, on the following day (Saturday), Nixon ordered Attorney General Richardson to fire Cox. Richardson refused and resigned in protest. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox. Ruckelshaus also refused and resigned.&lt;ref name="Discovery"/&gt;

Nixon then ordered the [[Solicitor General of the United States]], [[Robert Bork]], as acting head of the Justice Department, to fire Cox. Both Richardson and Ruckelshaus had given personal assurances to Congressional oversight committees that they would not interfere, but Bork had not. Although Bork later claimed he believed Nixon's order to be valid and appropriate, he still considered resigning to avoid being "perceived as a man who did the President's bidding to save my job".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noble|first1=Kenneth B.|title=Bork Irked by Emphasis on His Role in Watergate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/bork-irked-by-emphasis-on-his-role-in-watergate.html|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 2, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, having been brought to the White House by limousine and sworn in as acting attorney general, Bork wrote the letter firing Cox&lt;ref name= noble&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noble|first1=Kenneth B.|title=New Views Emerge Of Bork's Role in Watergate Dismissals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/26/us/new-views-emerge-of-bork-s-role-in-watergate-dismissals.html?src=pm|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 26, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and the Saturday Night Massacre was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Nixon Fires Cox; Richardson Quits|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nCtcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eVUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1370,1527272|work=[[The Vindicator]] |location=Youngstown, OH |date=October 21, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Initially, the Nixon White House claimed to have fired Ruckelshaus, but as an article published the next day by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' pointed out, "The letter from the President to Bork also said Ruckelshaus resigned", catching Nixon lying.&lt;ref name=Kilpatrick&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilpatrick |first=Carroll |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/102173-2.htm |title=Nixon Forces Firing of Cox; Richardson, Ruckelshaus Quit |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 21, 1973 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night he was fired, Cox's deputy prosecutor and press aides held an impassioned news briefing and read the following statement from him, "Whether ours shall continue to be a government of laws and not of men is now for Congress and ultimately the American people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oelsner|first1=Lesley|title=Cox Office Shut On Nixon's Order|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/21/archives/cox-office-shut-on-nixons-order-fbi-agents-impound-files-and.html|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 21, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 1973, federal district judge [[Gerhard Gesell]] ruled firing Cox was illegal absent a finding of extraordinary impropriety as specified in the regulation establishing the special prosecutor's office.&lt;ref name= noble/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ralph Nader|Nader]] v. Bork'', 366 F. Supp. 104 (D.D.C. 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Congress was infuriated by what it saw as a gross abuse of presidential power&amp;nbsp;– as were many Americans, who sent an unusually large number of [[telegram]]s to the White House and Congress in protest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120718162705/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KBIuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jn8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3099,1866772&amp;dq=western-union&amp;hl=en "Record Numbers Jam Western Union"].

[[File:NYTimes Saturday Night Massacre Front Page.gif|thumb|left|Front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 21, 1973, announcing the dismissal of Cox and the departure of Richardson and Ruckelshaus]]

Less than a week after the Saturday Night Massacre, an Oliver Quayle poll for NBC News indicated that, for the first time, a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of U.S. citizens supported [[Impeachment in the United States|impeaching]] Nixon, with 44% in favor, 43% opposed, and 13% undecided, with a sampling error of 2 to 3 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kJNYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VvgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2407,2360158&amp;dq=oliver-quayle&amp;hl=en "Poll Shows Many for Impeachment"]. Associated Press. ''Spokane Daily Chronicle''. October 23, 1973. p. 14. "... shows 44 per cent favored impeaching Nixon. Forty-three per cent opposed impeachment and 13 per cent were undecided, according to the poll…built-in sampling error of 2 to 3 per cent ..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the days that followed, numerous resolutions of impeachment against the president were introduced in Congress, and the [[impeachment process against Richard Nixon]] was underway. 

However, the House Judiciary Committee did not approve its first article of impeachment until July 27 the following year – more than nine months after the Saturday Night Massacre – when it charged Nixon with obstruction of justice. Two more articles of impeachment quickly followed.

Within two weeks, Nixon had made the decision to resign; following a [[Richard Nixon's resignation speech|televised speech]] in which he announced his intentions, he did so on August 9, 1974.

==Origin of the phrase==
The actual origin of the phrase is unknown; it first appeared in writing two days after the events, in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article by [[David S. Broder]] on October 22, but even in that article, Broder writes that the events were already "being called" the Saturday Night Massacre. In a 2017 article in the ''Washington Post'', Amy B. Wang attributed the phrase to humorist [[Art Buchwald]], based on the recollection of [[Sally Quinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/05/12/how-a-washington-post-humorist-became-connected-to-the-saturday-night-massacre/|title=Who coined ‘Saturday Night Massacre’? A birthday party at a YMCA may hold the key.|first=Amy B.|last=Wang|date=May 12, 2017|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and legacy==
[[File:Leon Jaworski.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Leon Jaworski]]]]
Nixon felt political pressure to allow Bork to appoint a new special prosecutor, and Bork chose [[Leon Jaworski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://verdict.justia.com/2017/06/30/summary-analysis-nixon-tapes-case-still-governs-important-aspects-executive-privilege-today |title=A Summary and Analysis of the Nixon Tapes Case That Still Governs Important Aspects of "Executive Privilege" Today |date=June 30, 2017 |first=Vikram David |last=Amar |authorlink=Vikram Amar |publisher=[[Justia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/a-political-volcano-just-erupted-is-the-us-on-the-brink-of-the-next-watergate |title='A political volcano just erupted': is the US on the brink of the next Watergate? |first=Stanley |last=Cloud |date=April 18, 2018|work=The Guardian |quote=At least 22 impeachment resolutions were quickly introduced in the House, along with 12 bills and resolutions ... calling for the appointment of a new special prosecutor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a question whether Jaworski would limit his investigation to the Watergate break-in or follow Cox's lead and look into other corrupt activities, such as those involving the "[[White House Plumbers]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rowland Evans|Evans, Rowland]]; [[Robert Novak|Novak, Robert]]. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W-INAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_2wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7215,609213&amp;dq=saturday-night-massacre&amp;hl=en "Nixon Hoping Jaworski Will Drop Plumber Probe"]. ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''. November 6, 1973. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing Cox's investigation, Jaworski did look at broader corruption involving the White House.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Rowland; Novak, Robert.

''[[The Free Lance–Star]]'' (Fredericksburg, Virginia). November 19, 1973. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Nixon continued to refuse to turn over the tapes, he agreed to release transcripts of a large number of them. Nixon said he did so partly because any audio pertinent to national security would have to be [[redaction|redacted]] from the tapes. There was further controversy on November 7 when an [[Nixon White House tapes#The 18 1/2-minute gap|18½-minute portion]] of one tape was found to have been erased. Nixon's personal secretary, [[Rose Mary Woods]], said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong foot pedal on her tape player while answering the phone. Later forensic analysis determined that the tape had been erased in several segments&amp;nbsp;– at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Clymer|Clymer, Adam]].

Nixon's presidency succumbed to mounting pressure resulting from the Watergate scandal and its cover-up. Faced with almost certain [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment and conviction,]] Nixon resigned.

In his posthumously published memoirs, Bork said Nixon promised him the next seat on the Supreme Court following Bork's role in firing Cox. Nixon was unable to carry out that promise, but [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|nominated Bork]] for the Supreme Court in 1987; his nomination nevertheless, failed in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301231021/http://news.yahoo.com/bork-nixon-offered-next-high-court-vacancy-73-215747517.html|archive-date=March 1, 2013|title=Bork: Nixon Offered Next High Court Vacancy in '73|url=https://news.yahoo.com/bork-nixon-offered-next-high-court-vacancy-73-215747517.html|publisher=[[ABC News]]|via=[[Yahoo!

{{Watergate|Congress}}
The '''Senate Watergate Committee''', known officially as the '''Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities''', was a [[special committee]] established by the [[United States Senate]], {{USBill|93|S.Res.|60}}, in 1973, to investigate the [[Watergate scandal]], with the power to investigate the break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) headquarters at the [[Watergate hotel|Watergate office complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and any subsequent cover-up of criminal activity, as well as "all other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct occurring during the controversial [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], including political espionage and campaign finance practices".

American print news media focused the nation's attention on the issue with hard-hitting investigative reports, while television news outlets brought the drama of the hearings to the living rooms of millions of American households, broadcasting the proceedings live for two weeks in May 1973. The [[public broadcasting|public television]] network [[PBS]] broadcast the hearings from gavel to gavel on more than 150 national affiliates.

Working under committee chairman [[Sam Ervin]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[North Carolina]]), the committee played a pivotal role in gathering evidence that would lead to the indictment of forty administration officials and the conviction of several of [[Richard Nixon]]'s aides for obstruction of justice and other crimes. Its revelations prompted the [[impeachment process against Nixon]], which featured the introduction of articles of impeachment against Nixon himself in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which led to his resignation on August 9, 1974.

==Background==
{{Main article|Watergate scandal}}
Shortly after midnight on June 17, 1972, five men were arrested inside the DNC offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 In Review |publisher=United Press International |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] launched an investigation of the incident, and the dogged reporting of two ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalists, [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]], raised questions and suggested connections between [[Richard Nixon]]'s controversial reelection campaign and the men awaiting trial. The [[White House]] denied any connection to the break-in, and Nixon [[1972 United States presidential election|won reelection in a landslide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/investigations/Watergate.htm|title=Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (''The Watergate Committee'')|publisher=Senate Historical Office|access-date=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following confirmation that such a connection did in fact exist, the Senate voted 77-0 in February 1973 to create the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Watergate_Investigation.htm|title=March 28, 1973: Watergate Leaks Lead to Open Hearings|publisher=Senate Historical Office|access-date=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearings opened on May 17, 1973, and the Committee issued its seven-volume, 1,250-page report on June 27, 1974, titled ''Report on Presidential Campaign Activities''. The first weeks of the committee's hearings were a national politico-cultural event. They were broadcast live during the day on commercial television; at the start, [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] covered them simultaneously, and then later on a rotation basis, while [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] replayed the hearings at night.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;Ronald Garay, [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/W/htmlW/watergate/watergate.htm "Watergate"], [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]. Accessed June 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 319 hours were broadcast overall, and 85% of U.S. households watched some portion of them.&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt; The audio feed also was broadcast, gavel-to-gavel, on scores of [[National Public Radio]] stations, making the hearings available to people in their cars and workplaces, and increased the profile of the fledgling broadcast organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/watergate/watergate-and-public-broadcasting "'Gavel-to-Gavel': The Watergate Scandal and Public Television", ''American Archive of Public Broadcasting''. Retrieved November 10, 2019.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearings made stars out of both Ervin, who became known for his folksy manner and wisdom but resolute determination, and Baker, who appeared somewhat non-partisan and uttered the famous phrase "What did the President know, and when did he know it?" (often paraphrased by others in later scandals). It was the introduction to the public for minority counsel Thompson, who would later become an actor, senator, and presidential candidate. Many of Watergate's most famous moments happened during the hearings, including [[John Dean]]'s "cancer on the Presidency" testimony and [[Alexander Butterfield]]'s revelation of the existence of the secret [[Nixon White House tapes]].

      <text bytes="4122" xml:space="preserve">The '''Responsiveness Program''', established in 1972 during the first presidency of [[Richard M. Nixon]], was a broad strategy to politicize the [[executive branch]] and use the power and resources of incumbency to ensure Nixon's re-election. The program included plans to "redirect federal funds to specific Administration supporters" and to "shape legal and regulatory action to enhance campaign goals."&lt;ref&gt;Senate Watergate Report,  "Use of the Incumbency-Responsiveness Program," Ch. III, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Outlined by [[Fred Malek]] in a memorandum to [[H.R. Haldeman]] on March 17, 1972, a comprehensive plan detailed how the resources and staff of the federal bureaucracy could be used to serve partisan objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Watergate Report, "The Responsiveness Program" - The Administration's Basic Plan to Employ Federal Resources to Affec the 1972 Presidential Election, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts were made to prevent the Responsiveness Program strategy from being associated with the White House staff or to President Nixon. In a memo to Haldeman dated December 23, 1971, Malek wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Naturally, carrying out this program, even if done discreetly, will represent a substantial risk. Trying to pressure 'non-political' civil servants to partisanly support the President's re-election would become quickly publicized and undoubtedly backfire. Consequently, the strategy should be to work through the top and medium-level political appointees who exercise control over most of the Departmental decisions and actions. Also, to minimize any direct links to the President, there should be no directions on this project in writing, and most of the initiative should come from the Department Heads themselves. (In fact, as this concept is refined further, I propose we stop calling it 'politicizing the Executive Branch,' and instead call it something like strengthening the Government responsiveness.)" &lt;ref&gt;Malek to Haldeman Dec. 23, 1971, quoted in Senate Watergate Report, Chapt III.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After interviewing over 150 witnesses and reviewing thousands of documents, the [[Senate Watergate Committee]] found evidence that through the Responsiveness Program: 
# funds for "grants, contract, loans, and subsidies" were illegally rechannelled to further re-election;
# government benefits were illegally offered in exchange for political support;
# campaign contributions were illegally solicited from beneficiaries of minority contracts;
# the White House was engaged with the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]] in a program to act through "special personnel referral units" to stack civil service positions with Nixon loyalists.

Though the Committee found evidence of obfuscation, destruction of documents, and removal of White House files relevant to the program and recommended prosecution, the Watergate Special Prosecution Force declined to file criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;Senate Watergate Report, Chapter III, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nixon Reconsidered|last=Hoff-Wilson|first=Joan|publisher=BasicBooks, A Member of Perseus Books Group|year=1994|isbn=0-465-05107-3|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nixonreconsidere00hoff/page/278 278]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/nixonreconsidere00hoff/page/278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelation of their existence and scope is among the many events of the [[Watergate scandal]]. More than 70 people were convicted of crimes related to Watergate (some pleaded guilty before trial).

Here is a listing of much of the criminality involved:
*Breaking into [[Daniel Ellsberg]]'s psychiatrist's office.
*Mitchell gave approval to the break-in at the Watergate.
*[[Charles Colson]] proposed firebombing the [[Brookings Institution]] and seizing politically damaging documents the President wanted destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/22/us/tapes-show-nixon-ordering-theft-of-files.html Tapes Show Nixon Ordering Theft of Files] New York Times, November 22, 1996 Accessed September 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[E. Howard Hunt]] fabricated documents implicating [[John F. Kennedy]] in the assassination of [[South Vietnam]]ese President [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]].
*[[John Ehrlichman]] ordered [[FBI]] Director [[L. Patrick Gray]] to take possession of the files in Hunt's safe, keeping them secret from prosecutors.
*Gray destroyed the evidence from Hunt's safe.
*Watergate investigator [[Henry E. Petersen]] gave [[John Dean]] secret grand jury testimony.
*Gray at the FBI gave Dean access to all FBI investigation files.
*Creation of the [[White House Plumbers]] to plug leaks through the use of illegal wiretaps.
*[[Operation Sandwedge]]: The [[Jack Caulfield]] operation designed to orchestrate a massive campaign to spy on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].
*Ehrlichman falsely claimed he did not know in advance about the Ellsberg break-in.
*[[Operation_Gemstone|Gemstone]]: The Liddy operation to kidnap students who might disrupt the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in 1972; use prostitutes to compromise Democratic politicians. Attorney General Mitchell objected to the plan on the grounds it cost too much; he later approved a scaled-down plan. Mitchell, Haldeman and [[Jeb Magruder]] approved of Gemstone.
*[[Hush money]] paid to Watergate break-in defendants.
*Nixon promised clemency to Watergate criminals.
*Caulfield sent to [[Chappaquiddick Island]] to pose as a reporter to dig up dirt on [[Ted Kennedy]] before all the leaks.
*Nixon is heard on the tapes telling Ehrlichman in April 1973 that he should hint to Dean to "stay on the reservation" because in the end the only man who can grant Dean clemency and save his ability to practice law is the president.
*[[Charles Colson]] was guilty of offering clemency to Hunt at Nixon's orders.
*Nixon told Petersen to stay out of the Ellsberg psychiatrist's break-in on the grounds that an investigation would compromise national security.
*Nixon proposed to [[Alexander Haig]] and [[Fred Buzhardt]] that they fabricate evidence—a missing dictabelt tape—wanted by Judge [[John Sirica]]; both refused.
*Nixon ordered the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] to audit the tax returns of [[Larry O'Brien]], head of the [[Democratic National Committee]].
*Nixon ordered the IRS to stop an investigation of [[Howard Hughes]].
*[[Huston Plan]]: In June 1970 Tom Huston persuaded the heads of the [[CIA]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]], and [[NSA]] to approve a plan for [[black bag job]]s against "enemies" of the Nixon administration. ([[J. Edgar Hoover]] opposed the Huston Plan; Nixon, fearful Hoover would blackmail him by leaking word of the plan, dropped it.)

      <text bytes="3541" xml:space="preserve">The phrase '''expletive deleted''' refers to [[profanity]] which has been censored by the author or by a subsequent censor, usually appearing in place of the profanity.  The phrase has been used for this purpose since at least the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Morning Chronicle |location=Manhattan, KS |date=1938-07-15 |page=3 |title=Interne Trouble |first=Elinore Crown |last=Stone |quote=Don't you know, you (expletive deleted) that dropping an instrument might be equivalent to murder?}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became more widely used in the United States after the [[Watergate scandal]].

==History==
Compelled by a subpoena to provide the contents of the White House taping system to the House Judiciary Committee in April 1974, President [[Richard Nixon]] ordered transcripts of the tapes to be prepared.  After a cursory inspection of the transcripts, Nixon, shocked at viewing several profanity-laced discussions amongst the White House's inner-circle, ordered that every use of profanity be replaced by "[EXPLETIVE DELETED]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Walker| first=Sam| title="Expletive Deleted": Nixon Releases Edited White House Watergate Tapes| url=http://todayinclh.com/?event=expletive-deleted-nixon-releases-edited-white-house-tapes| work=Today in Civil Liberties History (April 29, 1974)| accessdate=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=That time Nixon released doctored transcripts during Watergate| last=Brockell| first=Gillian| date=September 25, 2019| work=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/09/25/trump-ukraine-that-time-nixon-released-doctored-transcripts-during-watergate/| accessdate=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcripts were published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and elicited shock in much of the country, given Nixon's generally staid public image and the fact that contemporary media coverage of politicians did not usually report candidates' profanity use. As Nixon biographer [[Jonathan Aitken]] noted, Nixon had a rather broad view on what constituted profanity, and had ordered comparatively minor outbursts like ''[[Christ]]'' and ''[[hell]]'' to be replaced as expletives. Seeing the jarring phrase repeatedly within the transcripts seemed to give the public the impression that the words used were far harsher than what actually appeared on the tapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, Johnathan:  "Nixon, A Life" Page 515&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase entered the public imagination to the point where protesters outside the White House held up picket signs reading, "IMPEACH THE (EXPLETIVE DELETED)!"

In later years, the phrase became commonplace as an [[irony|ironic]] expression which indicates that a profanity has been omitted; this catchphrase has passed into general usage as a convenient [[Natural language|linguistic]] [[figleaf]].

==Technical definition==
The term ''expletive'' is commonly used outside linguistics to refer to any bad language (or profanity), used with or without meaning. ''Expletives'' in this wide sense may be [[adjective]]s,  [[adverb]]s, [[noun]]s, or (most commonly), [[interjection]]s, or (rarely) [[verb]]s. Within linguistics, an expletive always refers to a word without meaning, namely a [[syntactic expletive]] or [[expletive attributive]]. In this technical sense, an expletive is not necessarily rude.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="10253" xml:space="preserve">The term '''corrupt bargain''' refers to three historic incidents in [[History of the United States|American history]] in which political agreement was determined by congressional or presidential actions that acted against the most clearly defined legal course of action at the time (though in none of the three cases were illegal actions taken). Two of these involved the resolution of indeterminate or disputed electoral votes from the [[United States presidential election]] process, and the third involved the disputed use of a presidential pardon. In all three cases, the president so elevated served a single term, or singular vacancy, and either did not run again, or was not reelected when he ran.  

In the [[United States presidential  election, 1824|1824 election]], without an absolute majority in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]] dictated that the Presidential election be sent to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], whose  [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] and candidate in his own right, [[Henry Clay]], gave his support to [[John Quincy Adams]], and was then selected to be his [[Secretary of State]].  In the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 election]], accusations of corruption stemmed from officials involved in counting the necessary and hotly contested electoral votes of both sides, in which [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] was elected by a congressional commission.  
==Election of 1824==
[[File:ElectoralCollege1824-Large.png|thumb|250px|Votes in the Electoral College, 1824]]
[[File:Election in House1824-Large.PNG|thumb|250px|The voting by state in the House of Representatives, 1825. Note that all of Clay's states voted for Adams.]]
After the votes were counted in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1824|U.S. presidential election of 1824]], no candidate had received the majority needed of the Presidential Electoral votes (although Andrew Jackson had the most&lt;ref&gt;https://www.270towin.com/1824_Election/&lt;/ref&gt;), thereby putting the outcome in the hands of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. There were four candidates on the ballot: John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and William H. Crawford. Following the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment, however, only the top three candidates in the electoral vote were admitted as candidates, eliminating [[Henry Clay]].

To the surprise of many, the House elected [[John Quincy Adams]] over rival [[Andrew Jackson]]. It was widely believed that Clay, the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], convinced Congress to elect Adams, who then made Clay his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Jackson's supporters denounced this as a "corrupt bargain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://history1800s.about.com/od/leaders/a/electionof1824.htm "The Election of 1824 Was Decided in the House of Representatives: The Controversial Election was Denounced as 'The Corrupt Bargain'"], Robert McNamara, About.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stenberg | first1 = R. R. | title = Jackson, Buchanan, and the "Corrupt Bargain" Calumny | journal = The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–85 | doi = 10.2307/20086857| year = 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "corrupt bargain" that placed Adams in the White House and Clay in the State Department launched a four-year campaign of revenge by the friends of Andrew Jackson.

Claiming that the people had been cheated of their choice, [[Jacksonians]] attacked the Adams administration at every turn as illegitimate and tainted by aristocracy and corruption. Adams aided his own defeat by failing to rein in the [[pork barrel]] frenzy sparked by the [[General Survey Act]]. Jackson's attack on the national blueprint put forward by Adams and Clay won support from Old Republicans and market liberals, the latter of which increasingly argued that Congressional involvement in [[internal improvements]] was an open invitation to special interests and [[logrolling|political logrolling]].&lt;ref&gt;Book review of John Lauritz Larson's [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=6907 Internal Improvement: National Public Works and the Promise of Popular Government in the Early United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1998 analysis using [[game theory]] mathematics argued that contrary to the assertions of Jackson, his supporters, and countless later historians, the results of the election were consistent with so-called "sincere voting", that is, those Members of the House of Representatives who were unable to cast votes for their most-favored candidate apparently voted for their second- (or third-) most-favored candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Jenkins| first = Jeffrey| last2 = Sala| first2 = Brian| title = The Spatial Theory of Voting and the Presidential Election of 1824| journal = American Journal of Political Science| volume = 42| issue = 4| pages = 1157–1179| year = 1998| doi = 10.2307/2991853| publisher = Midwest Political Science Association| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;| jstor = 2991853}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regardless of the various theories concerning the matter, Adams was a one-term President; his rival, Jackson, was elected President by a large majority of the electors in the [[election of 1828]] and then a second term in the [[election of 1832]].

==Election of 1876==
{{main article|Compromise of 1877}}
The [[1876 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1876]] is sometimes considered to be a second "corrupt bargain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stpetersburgtimes.com/News/111700/Election2000/Election_2000_much_li.shtml "Election 2000 much like Election 1876"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807173410/http://www.stpetersburgtimes.com/News/111700/Election2000/Election_2000_much_li.shtml |date=2011-08-07}}, Wes Allison, ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', November 17, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[Southern United States|Southern]] states had contested vote counts, and each sent the results of two different slates of electors. Since both candidates needed those electoral votes to win the election, Congress appointed a special Electoral Commission to settle the dispute over which slates of electors to accept. After the commission awarded all the disputed electoral votes to the Republican candidate, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], and Congress voted to accept their report, some dissatisfied Democrats claimed that Hayes or his supporters had made a secret compromise to secure the support of some Congressional Democrats. Most of the items in the alleged "[[Compromise of 1877]]" were either never acted on, which calls into question whether they were ever agreed to, or had already been the established position of Hayes from the time of his accepting the Republican nomination and so were not a sudden "compromise".

Hayes's detractors labeled the alleged compromise a "Corrupt Bargain"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= J. Michael Martinez|title=Carpetbaggers, Cavalry, and the Ku Klux Klan: Exposing the Invisible Empire During Reconstruction (The American Crisis Series: Books on the Civil War Era) |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc |location=Lanham, Md |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7425-5078-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mocked him with the nickname "Rutherfraud."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/12/uselections2000.usa4 "A pill too bitter to swallow"], guardian.co.uk, Sunday November 12, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most often cited item in the "compromise" was the agreement to accept Southern "home rule" by withdrawing the remaining Northern troops from Southern capitals. That would remove an important tool the federal government had used to force the South to uphold the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] Amendments, which were intended to protect the rights of [[African-Americans]], particularly their right to vote.  

Generally, political support for maintaining the troops had dissipated during Grant's second term, and Hayes had little choice but to accept some form of "home rule." He attempted to do so, as stated in his nomination acceptance letter, by gaining promises from Southern states that they would respect the rights, and especially the voting rights, of the freedmen. On the other political side, the Democratic platform of [[Samuel Tilden]], also promised removal of troops, but with no mention of any attempts to guarantee the freedmen's rights. For a time, Hayes's approach had some success, but gradually Southern states moved to build new barriers to their right to vote.

==1974 pardon of Nixon==
{{main article|Pardon of Richard Nixon}}
[[Gerald Ford]]'s 1974 [[pardon of Richard Nixon]] was described as a "corrupt bargain" by critics of the disgraced former president.{{Citation needed|reason=Other instances of description of an event as a corrupt bargain in the article are cited. I was unable to find a primary source describing Nixon's pardon as such.|date=December 2019}} The critics claimed that Ford's pardon was [[quid pro quo]] for Nixon's resignation, which elevated Ford to the presidency. The most public critic was US Representative [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], who, as the lowest-ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, was the only representative who explicitly asked whether the pardon was a quid pro quo. Ford cut Holtzman off, declaring, "There was no deal, period, under no circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29pardon.html "For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut"] The New York Times, December 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Follow the money'''" is a [[catchphrase]] popularized by the 1976 [[docudrama]] film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', which suggests [[political corruption]] can be brought to light by examining money transfers between parties.

==Origin==
For the film, screenwriter [[William Goldman]] attributed the phrase to [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]], the informant who took part in revealing the [[Watergate scandal]]. However, the phrase is mentioned neither in the [[All the President's Men|non-fiction book that preceded the film]], nor in any documentation of the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thatwasnotinthebook.com/diff/all-the-president%27s-men|title=Differences between All the President's Men Book vs Movie Page 1|website=thatwasnotinthebook.com|access-date=2018-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book does contain the phrase "The key was the secret campaign cash, and it should all be traced," which Woodward says to Senator [[Sam Ervin]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Bernstein, All the President's Men, Chapter 12, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The phrase ''Follow the money'' was mentioned by [[Henry E. Peterson]] at the 1974 [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] hearings as [[Earl J. Silbert]] was nominated to U.S. Attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freakonomics.com/2011/09/23/follow-the-money/|title=Follow the Money|last=Shapiro|first=Fred|date=2011-09-23|website=Freakonomics|language=en|access-date=2018-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1975 book by Clive Borrell and Brian Cashinella, ''Crime in Britain Today'', also uses the phrase.

Since the 1970s, "follow the money" has been used several times in [[investigative journalism]] and [[political debate]]. One example is ''Follow the Money'', a series of CBS reports.

===Donald Trump===
In September 2016, the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump campaign]] used the phrase in criticizing [[Hillary Clinton]] and the [[Clinton Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schreckinger |first1=Ben |last2=Vogel |first2=Kenneth P. |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/trump-iowa-money-228873 |title=Trump launches 'follow the money' attack |work=Politico |date=September 28, 2016 |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, [[Carl Bernstein]] used the phrase to encourage reporters to discover [[Presidency of Donald Trump|President Trump]]'s potential conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Skoczek |first=Tim |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/02/politics/carl-bernstein-axe-files/ |title=Carl Bernstein on covering Trump: Follow the money |date=February 2, 2017 |work=CNN |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the [[Watergate scandal]], '''Operation Gemstone''' was a proposed series of clandestine or illegal acts, first outlined by [[G. Gordon Liddy]] in two separate meetings with three other individuals: then-[[Attorney General of the United States]], [[John N. Mitchell]], then-White House Counsel [[John Dean]], and [[Jeb Stuart Magruder|Jeb Magruder]], an ally and former aide to [[H.R. Haldeman]], as well as the temporary head of the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]], pending Mitchell's resignation as Attorney General.

The first meeting occurred in the Attorney General's [[Washington, D.C.]], office at 11:00 a.m. on January 27, 1972. Liddy described in great detail both his plan to disrupt the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, and his plan to prevent any disruption of the upcoming Republican National Convention, then scheduled to take place in San Diego, California. Liddy's proposals would cost approximately $1 million to carry out. Among the various elements of Gemstone were plans to kidnap specific "radical" leaders, and others who might cause trouble at the Republican Convention, and hold them in Mexico until after the Convention was over. According to all four participants of the January 27 meeting, Attorney General Mitchell declared, with some evident sarcasm, "Gordon, that's not quite what I had in mind."

John Dean described his recollections of this meeting to President Nixon on March 21, 1973, during the "[[Cancer on the Presidency]]" conversation: "So I came over and Liddy laid out a million dollar plan that was the most incredible thing I have ever laid my eyes on: all in codes, and involved black bag operations, kidnapping, providing prostitutes, uh, to weaken the opposition, bugging, uh, mugging teams. It was just an incredible thing."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/886-008.pdf "TRANSCRIPT PREPARED BY THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY STAFF FOR THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF A RECORDING OF A MEETING AMONG THE PRESIDENT, JOHN DEAN AND H.R. HALDEMAN ON MARCH 21, 1973 FROM 10:12 TO 11:55 A.M."&lt;/ref&gt;

The second meeting occurred one week later, on February 4, 1972, again at Mitchell's office. The participants of this meeting were the same four men as the first, although John Dean was not present for the entire meeting. Dean himself later testified that he arrived "very late" to the meeting. Liddy, Magruder, and Mitchell all disputed this claim. At the February 4 meeting, Liddy proposed a scaled-down plan that would cost $500,000 to enact. While less ambitious than the January 27 agenda, "Operation Gemstone" still involved several proposed criminal acts, most notably including the use of wiretaps to eavesdrop on telephone conversations involving Democratic party leaders.&lt;ref name="Brown2010"&gt;H. Brown. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OUPFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 High Crimes and Misdemeanors in Presidential Impeachment]''.

Beginning in April 1973, as the Watergate scandal began to unravel, Magruder and Dean both gave public and private testimony that was very damaging to John Mitchell. For his part, Liddy remained silent until the publication of his memoir ''Will'' in April 1980. However, all four men have publicly stated that the February 4 meeting adjourned without Mitchell having expressed any approval for any of Liddy's plans. More specifically, all four participants have publicly agreed that the break-in of the Democratic National Committee's Watergate offices, generally considered the emblematic crime of the Watergate scandal, did not come up in the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, James: The Strong Man: John Mitchell and the Secrets of Watergate, (Doubleday: 2008) pp. 258-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BgbkAAAAMAAJ Newsweek]''.

'''''United States v. Nixon''''', 418 U.S. 683 (1974), was a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that resulted in a unanimous decision against [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], ordering him to deliver tape recordings and other subpoenaed materials to a federal district court. Issued on July 24, 1974, the decision was important to the late stages of the [[Watergate scandal]], when there was an ongoing [[impeachment process against Richard Nixon]]. ''United States v. Nixon'' is considered a crucial precedent limiting the power of any U.S. president to claim [[executive privilege]].

[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren E. Burger]] wrote the opinion for a unanimous court, joined by [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices]] [[William O. Douglas]], [[William J. Brennan]], [[Potter Stewart]], [[Byron White]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Harry Blackmun]] and [[Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.|Lewis F. Powell]]. Burger, Blackmun, and Powell were appointed to the Court by Nixon during his first term.

== Summary ==
The case arose out of the [[Watergate scandal]], which began during the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential campaign]] between President Nixon and his Democratic challenger, Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota. On June 17, 1972, about five months before the election, five men broke into [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters located in the [[Watergate Office Building]] in Washington, D.C.; these men were later found to have ties with the Nixon administration.&lt;ref name=Burglary2004CNN&gt;{{cite news| title=A burglary turns into a constitutional crisis| date=June 16, 2004| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/06/11/watergate/index.html| website=cnn.com| accessdate=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1973, Attorney General [[Elliot Richardson]] appointed [[Archibald Cox]] to the position of [[special prosecutor]], charged with investigating the break-in.&lt;ref name=SWH1973&gt;{{Cite web| title=Senate Hearings: Overview| url=https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/museum/exhibits/watergate_files/content.php?section=2&amp;page=a| website=fordlibrarymuseum.gov| accessdate=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, on October 20, Nixon ordered that Cox be fired, precipitating the immediate departures of both Richardson and Deputy Attorney General [[William Ruckelshaus]] in what became known as the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Elliot Richardson Dies at 79; Stood Up to Nixon and Resigned In 'Saturday Night Massacre'| last=Lewis| first=Neil A.| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/us/elliot-richardson-dies-79-stood-up-nixon-resigned-saturday-night-massacre.html| date=January 1, 2000| work=The New York Times| accessdate=October 31, 2019| via=The Times's print archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Saturday Night Massacre: How our Constitution trumped a reckless President| date=October 20, 2015| last=Gormley| first=Ken| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-saturday-night-massacre-40-years-later-how-our-constitution-trumped-a-r| work=Constitution Daily| publisher=National Constitutional Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| accessdate=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox's firing kindled a firestorm of protest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle| date=October 28, 1973| title=Nixon Backs Down After A 'Firestorm' of Protest| url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Watergate/Watergate%20Items%2007668%20to%2007990/Watergate%2007843.pdf| accessdate=October 31, 2019| via=The Weisberg Collection.

In April 1974, Jaworski obtained a [[subpoena]] ordering Nixon to release certain tapes and papers related to specific meetings between the President and those [[indicted]] by the grand jury. Those tapes and the conversations they revealed were believed to contain damaging evidence involving the indicted men and perhaps the President himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/22/us/politics/can-president-be-indicted-kenneth-starr-memo.html|title=Can the President Be Indicted? A Long-Hidden Legal Memo Says Yes|date=July 22, 2017|publisher=Arthur Gregg Sulzberger|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoping that Jaworski and the public would be satisfied, Nixon turned over edited transcripts of 43 conversations, including portions of 20 conversations demanded by the subpoena. [[James D. St. Clair]], Nixon's attorney, then requested Judge [[John Sirica]] of the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] to [[quash]] the subpoena. While arguing before Sirica, St. Clair stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The President wants me to argue that he is as powerful a monarch as [[Louis XIV]], only four years at a time, and is not subject to the processes of any court in the land except the court of impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Supremes' Greatest Hits: The 34 Supreme Court Cases That Most Directly Affect Your Life |last=Trachtman |first=Michael G. |year=2007 |publisher=Sterling|location= |isbn=978-1-4027-4107-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/supremesgreatest0000trac/page/131 131] |url=https://archive.org/details/supremesgreatest0000trac |url-access=registration |quote=President wants me to argue that he is as powerful a monarch as Louis XIV. |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sirica denied Nixon's motion and ordered the President to turn the tapes over by May 31.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Mitchell'', {{cite court |litigants= |vol=377 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=1326 |pinpoint= |court=[[D.D.C.]] |date=1974 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/377/1326/2343516/ |accessdate=2019-02-02 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Nixon and Jaworski appealed directly to the Supreme Court, which heard arguments on July 8. Nixon's attorney argued the matter should not be subject to "judicial resolution" since the matter was a dispute within the executive branch and the branch should resolve the dispute itself. Also, he claimed Special Prosecutor Jaworski had not proven the requested materials were absolutely necessary for the trial of the seven men. Besides, he claimed Nixon had an absolute [[executive privilege]] to protect communications between "high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in carrying out their duties."

== Decision ==
Less than three weeks after oral arguments, the Court issued its decision.

Within the court there was never much doubt about the general outcome. July 9, the day following oral arguments, all eight justices (Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] recused himself due to his close association with several Watergate conspirators, including Attorneys General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] and [[Richard Kleindienst]], prior to his appointment to the Court) indicated to each other that they would rule against the president.&lt;ref name=wb-368&gt;[[Bob Woodward]] and [[Scott Armstrong (journalist)|Scott Armstrong]], ''[[The Brethren (non-fiction)|The Brethren]]'', p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; The justices struggled to settle on an opinion that all eight could agree to, however, with the major issue being how much of a constitutional standard could be established for what executive privilege ''did'' mean.

Burger's first draft was deemed problematic and insufficient by the rest of the court, leading the other Justices to criticize and re-write major parts of the draft. The final draft would eventually heavily incorporate Justice Blackmun's re-writing of Facts of the Case, Justice Douglas' appealability section, Justice Brennan's thoughts on standing, Justice White's standards on admissibility and relevance, and Justices Powell and Stewart's interpretation of the executive privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The stakes were so high, in that the tapes most likely contained evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the President and his men, that they wanted no dissent.&lt;ref&gt; Woodward, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Chief Justice's hostility to allowing the other Justices to participate in the drafting of the opinion, the final version was agreed to on July 23, the day before the decision was announced, and would contain the work of all the Justices.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;  Chief Justice Burger delivered the decision from the bench and the very fact that he was doing so meant that knowledgeable onlookers realized the decision must be unanimous.

The Court's opinion found that the courts could indeed intervene on the matter and that Special Counsel Jaworski had proven a "sufficient likelihood that each of the tapes contains conversations relevant to the offenses charged in the indictment". While the Court acknowledged that the principle of executive privilege did exist, the Court would also directly reject President Nixon's claim to an "absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances."

The Court held that a claim of Presidential privilege as to materials subpoenaed for use in a criminal trial cannot override the needs of the judicial process if that claim is based, not on the ground that military or diplomatic secrets are implicated, but merely on the ground of a generalized interest in confidentiality. Nixon was then ordered to deliver the subpoenaed materials to the District Court.

[[Watergate scandal#Final investigations and resignation|Nixon resigned]] sixteen days later, on August 9, 1974.

The '''Martha Mitchell effect''' is the process by which a psychiatrist, psychologist, other [[mental health]] clinician, or a medical professional&lt;ref&gt;http://patient-safety.com/blacklisting-patients.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, labels the patient's accurate perception of real events as [[delusional]] and [[misdiagnoses]] accordingly.

==Description==
According to Bell et al., "Sometimes, improbable reports are erroneously assumed to be symptoms of mental illness", due to a "failure or inability to verify whether the events have actually taken place, no matter how improbable intuitively they might appear to the busy clinician".

Examples of such situations are:

* Pursuit by [[organized crime|organized criminals]]
* [[Surveillance]] by law enforcement officers
* Infidelity by a spouse
* Physical issues

Quoting psychotherapist [[Joseph Berke]], the authors report that, "even [[Paranoia|paranoid]]s have enemies". Any patient, they explain, can be misdiagnosed by clinicians, especially patients with a history of [[paranoid delusion]]s.

Patients may be diagnosed as delusional when their grievances concern health care workers and/or health care institutions, even when the patient has no history of delusion. "A patient arriving claiming to have been injured by another health care professional is regarded as a crazy person who potentially could ruin the career of an innocent colleague."&lt;ref&gt;http://patient-safety.com/blacklisting-patients.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Psychologist [[Brendan Maher (psychologist)|Brendan Maher]] named the effect after [[Martha Beall Mitchell]].&lt;ref name=Maher1988&gt;Maher, Brendan A. (1988) "Anomalous Experience and Delusional Thinking: The Logic of Explanations". In T. Oltmanns and B. Maher (eds) ''Delusional Beliefs''. New York: Wiley Interscience&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell was the wife of [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], [[United States Attorney General|Attorney-General]] in the [[Nixon administration]]. When she alleged that [[White House]] officials were engaged in illegal activities, her claims were attributed to mental illness. Ultimately, however, the facts of the [[Watergate scandal]] vindicated her and garnered her the label, "The [[Cassandra]] of Watergate". 

Although it has been stated that many of her allegations remain unproven, such as her claim that she had been drugged and put under guard during a visit to California after her husband was summoned back to [[Washington, D.C.]], in order to prevent her from leaving the hotel or making phone calls to the news media.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Richard ''President Nixon: Alone in the White House'', p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; [[James W. McCord, Jr|James McCord]] admitted in 1975 that her story was true, as reported in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/19/archives/mccord-declares-that-mrs-mitchell-was-forcibly-held-comment-from.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; More supporting evidence that Martha was telling the truth was published in a 2017 news article in ''[[Newsweek]]'' about the appointment of a U.S. ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsweek.com/2017/12/29/donald-trump-watergate-stephen-king-martha-mitchell-richard-nixon-john-744823.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Watergate Seven''' has come to refer to two different groups of people, both of them in the context of the [[Watergate scandal]]. Firstly, it can refer to the five men caught on June 17, 1972, burglarizing the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s headquarters in the [[Watergate complex]], along with their two handlers, [[E.&amp;nbsp;Howard Hunt]] and [[G.&amp;nbsp;Gordon Liddy]], who were Nixon campaign aides. All seven were tried before [[Judge John Sirica]] in January 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/06/11/AR2005112200811_3.html |title=The Watergate Watershed A Turning Point for a Nation and a Newspaper |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Katharine |last=Graham |date=January 28, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second use of '''Watergate Seven''' refers to seven advisors and aides of [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] who were indicted by a [[grand jury]] on March 1, 1974, for their roles in the Watergate scandal. The grand jury also named Nixon as an [[unindicted co-conspirator]]. The indictments marked the first time in U.S. history that a president was so named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Watergate Exposed: How the President of the United States and the Watergate Burglars Were Set Up As Told to Douglas Caddy, Original Attorney for the Watergate Seven |last=Merritt |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Merritt |author2=Doug Caddy  |year=2011 |publisher=Trine Day |isbn=193629611X |page= |pages=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period leading up to the trial of the first Watergate Seven began on January 8, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Graham |first=Katharine |page= |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 28, 1997 |title=The Watergate watershed: a turning point for a nation and a newspaper |accessdate=July 5, 2012 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/06/11/AR2005112200811_3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Watergate Seven" was coined a few months later, in April 1973, by American lawyer, politician, and political commentator [[Ed Koch]], who, in response to [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]]'s indicating that one of the men in the Watergate bugging case had been ordered in the spring of 1972 to keep certain Senators and Representatives under [[surveillance]], posted a sign on the door of his [[United States Congress]] office saying, "These premises were surveilled by the Watergate Seven. Watch yourself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Madden |first=Richard L. |page=19 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 7, 1973 |title=Javits Picks a Campaign Team, Citing the Need to Think Ahead; Votes in Congress This Week's Tally for Metropolitan Area Senate House |accessdate=July 5, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/07/archives/javits-picks-a-campaign-team-citing-the-need-to-think-ahead-votes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven advisors and aides later indicted in 1974 were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |page=16 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 2, 1974 |title=Sketches of the Seven Nixon Aides Indicted by the Watergate Grand Jury  |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0613FB3B551A7493C0A91788D85F408785F9 |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Watergate Babies''' are [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] first elected to the [[United States Congress]] in the [[1974 United States elections|1974 elections]], following [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation over the [[Watergate scandal]], on August 9, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Balz|authorlink=|page=|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=10 August 1980|title=Democrats: Off Track To Some|accessdate=6 March 2018|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/08/10/democrats-off-track-to-some/1b878bdf-2e6e-4b0d-8057-bf2e925d290e/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joseph F.|last=Sullivan|page=46|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 14, 1980|title=Maguire Faces Rerun Of Tight '78 Race|accessdate=July 5, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/09/14/archives/maguire-faces-rerun-of-tight-78-race-rhodes-visits-the-district.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222193459/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D1FFA3E5C17728DDDAD0994D1405B8084F1D3|archivedate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Joseph Downey|Tom Downey]] of New York was the youngest among the "babies", aged 25 upon his election, the minimum age at which one may serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. Future Senators [[Chris Dodd]] (D-[[Connecticut]]), [[Tom Harkin]] (D-[[Iowa]]), [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]] (D-[[Illinois]]), [[Paul Tsongas]] (D-[[Massachusetts]]), [[Max Baucus]] (D-[[Montana]]), and [[Bob Krueger]] (D-[[Texas]]) were also elected to Congress in this election cycle. In November 1974, Democrats picked up 49 seats in the [[U.S. House|House]] and 5 in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. This group greatly increased the strength of Northerners and liberals in the House Democratic Caucus. They teamed up with some more senior liberals to strike a blow against the [[seniority]] system and overthrew three committee chairmen whom they viewed as too conservative and/or too old to represent the Democratic Party in these prominent positions: [[William Poage]], [[Wright Patman]] and [[F. Edward Hébert]].

Only one Watergate Baby is still a member of the U.S. Congress: Senаtor [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-[[Vermont]]), first elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1974.

"Watergate Babies" can also apply to those Democrats elected to state or local office in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Irene Jay |last=Liu |title=A 70's flashback at Capitol |date=December 14, 2009 |work=timesunion.com |url=https://www.timesunion.com/local/article/A-70s-flashback-at-capitol-555390.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The last of the Watergate babies |date=April 2, 2007 |work=[[Democrat and Chronicle]] |url=http://blogs.democratandchronicle.com/political/?p=255 |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628235113/http://blogs.democratandchronicle.com/political/?p=255 |archivedate=June 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Democrats made substantial state legislative gains in a large number of states in 1974, the [[Watergate]] election," the political scientist Malcolm Jewell wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American State Political Parties and Elections |isbn=978-0256026627 |p=[https://archive.org/details/americanstatepol00jewe/page/228 228] |year=1982 |first=Malcolm Edwin |last=Jewell |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/americanstatepol00jewe/page/228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous states passed sweeping ethics and public disclosure reforms in the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;STATE GOVERNMENT, Volumes 65-66 (1992), page 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald J. |last=Hrenebar |first2=Clive G. |last2=Thomas |isbn=978-0-271-02576-6 |title=Interest Group Politics in the Northeastern States

"Watergate Babies" has also been used to apply to journalists who entered journalism because of their fascination with the [[Watergate]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Madison |last=Taylor |title=Confessions of a Watergate baby |work=[[Times-News (Burlington, North Carolina)|Times-News]] |date=May 17, 2013 |url=http://www.thetimesnews.com/news/local-columnists/madison-taylor/confessions-of-a-watergate-baby-1.144812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Watergate," David Baumann wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Baumann |title=The Legacy of Watergate |work=About.com US Politics |date=June 18, 2011 |url=http://uspolitics.about.com/b/2011/06/18/the-legacy-of-watergate.htm |accessdate=July 5, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513135200/http://uspolitics.about.com/b/2011/06/18/the-legacy-of-watergate.htm |archivedate=May 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "also created a generation of journalists who were not willing to accept politicians at their word. If the journalists who helped uncover the scandal, [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]], could expose the crimes of a president, then certainly there were crooked politicians elsewhere. Those journalists believed in investigative reporting and became watchdogs who attempted to keep politicians honest.&lt;ref name="2018 Politico article" /&gt;

==Legacy==

In 2018 ''[[Politico]]'', along with some of the surviving Watergate Babies, reflected on their long-term impact. The magazine concluded that the reforms to the committee structure, and the increased transparency, they worked for had permanently changed Congress as an institution. However, those changes had, ''Politico'' argued, helped contribute to  the later rise of the [[New Right#Second New Right|New Right]] and shaped the polarized political climate of the late 2010s.&lt;ref name="2018 Politico article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=John A.|title=How the 'Watergate Babies' Broke American Politics|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/26/congress-broke-american-politics-218544|newspaper=[[Politico]]|date=May 26, 2018|accessdate=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Watergate Babies often framed what had previously been policy goals—such as stronger consumer protection and environmental cleanup—as rights, a discursive tactic that ''Politico'' noted would later be adopted by conservatives. On the House floor, the new members' willingness to vote as a bloc forced votes on divisive issues that their more senior colleagues had long avoided, another tactic that conservatives successfully emulated. When House sessions later began to be broadcast on television in 1979, another reform the Babies had sought, a younger conservative, [[Newt Gingrich]], began using after-hours "[[special order (parliamentary procedure)|special orders]]" to attack Democrats, which drew to him the prestige and followers that eventually led to the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994 Republican takeover]] of the House, with Gingrich becoming Speaker.&lt;ref name="2018 Politico article" /&gt;

"We came here to take the Bastille," recalled [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]], who remained in Congress until 2015, one of the last Watergate Babies to retire. "We destroyed the institution by turning the lights on."&lt;ref name="2018 Politico article" /&gt;

The '''White House Plumbers''', sometimes simply called '''the Plumbers''', the "'''Room 16 Project'''," or more officially, the White House '''"Special Investigations Unit"''' was a covert [[White House]] Special Investigations Unit, established within a week after the publication of the "Pentagon Papers" in June 1971, during the presidency of [[Richard Nixon]]. Its task was to stop and/or respond to the [[news leak|leaking]] of [[classified information]], such as the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'', to the news media. The work of the unit "tapered-off" after the bungled "Ellsberg break-in" but some of its former operatives branched into illegal activities while still employed at the White House together with managers of the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]], including the [[Watergate burglary|Watergate break-in]] and the ensuing Watergate scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=II.

==Name==
On Thanksgiving evening of 1971, [[David Young (Watergate)|David Young]] arrived home from his planning at the Special Investigative Unit, when his grandmother asked him, "What do you do at the White House?" He replied, "I am helping the president stop some leaks." She exclaimed, "Oh, you're a plumber!" Young, [[E. Howard Hunt]], and [[G. Gordon Liddy]] then put up a sign on their office with the title "The Plumbers" but it was taken down since their covert operations were supposed to be top secret. Still, the name stuck for the group.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, John W. ''The Nixon Defense'', p. 663n. Penguin Group, 2014. {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The Plumbers came to include several Watergate figures including [[Frank Sturgis]]. Hunt was recommended by [[Charles Colson]], and Liddy was recommended by [[Egil Krogh]]. Liddy coined his own [[sensitivity indicator]] for the group in the form of "ODESSA".&lt;ref name="Liddy"&gt;Liddy. ''Will'', pp. 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors believe [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) officer [[John Paisley (CIA officer)|John Paisley]] was a member of the Plumbers. Paisley was assigned to the CIA's Office of Security, of which Nixon campaign security coordinator and Watergate burglar [[James W. McCord Jr.|James McCord]] was once a member. On August 9, 1971, Young's memo indicates he met with Paisley and OS Director Howard Osborn, in which Paisley provided a list of objectives for the Special Investigations Unit.&lt;ref name="Hougan38"&gt;Jim Hougan. ''Secret Agenda'', pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The Plumbers' first task was the burglary of the office of [[Daniel Ellsberg]]'s [[Los Angeles]] psychiatrist, [[Lewis J. Fielding]], in an effort to uncover evidence to discredit Ellsberg, who had leaked the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]''. The operation was reportedly unsuccessful in finding Ellsberg's file and was so reported to the White House. However, Fielding himself stated the file was in his office; he found it on the floor on the morning after the burglary and quite clearly, someone had gone through it.&lt;ref name="Hougan47"&gt;Jim Hougan. ''Secret Agenda'', p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 1971 conversation, [[John Ehrlichman]] advised Nixon, "We had one little operation; it's been aborted out in Los Angeles which, I think, is better that you don't know about." Eventually, the case against Ellsberg was dismissed due to government misconduct.

Aside from the Fielding burglary, there are few other activities the Plumbers were known to have been engaged in.  Hunt reportedly looked into the [[Ted Kennedy]]-[[Chappaquiddick incident]] and Liddy reported purported Kennedy administration involvement in the assassination of [[South Vietnam]]ese President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]].&lt;ref name="Liddy"/&gt;

After the California break-in, Liddy—who was general counsel, a member of the finance committee of the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]] (CRP) and promoted from aide to Krogh and Young—worked with Campaign political-intelligence operations. Ehrlichman, the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Special Investigations Unit, knew about Liddy's goal to perform an intelligence-gathering operation for the CRP. Liddy involved Hunt in the operations which would later include the [[Watergate burglary]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean, John W. (2014). ''The Nixon Defense'', p. 13.

{{Watergate|CRP}}
The '''Committee for the Re-election of the President''' (also known as the '''Committee to Re-elect the President'''), abbreviated '''CRP''', but often mocked by the acronym '''CREEP''',&lt;ref name="Purcell2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Hoff|editor=L. Edward Purcell|title=Richard Milhous Nixon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zq3-BuDVQfMC&amp;pg=PA342|volume=Vice Presidents: A Biographical Dictionary|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-3071-2|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; was, officially, a [[fundraising]] organization of [[United States]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 re-election campaign]].

== History ==
Planning began in late 1970 and an office opened in the spring of 1971. Besides its re-election activities, CRP employed [[money laundering]] and [[slush fund]]s, and was involved in the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nixon.archives.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/deeded/crp-malek.php |title=Committee for the Re-Election of the President Collection: Frederic Malek Papers |publisher=[[Nixon Presidential Library &amp; Museum]] |access-date=2010-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531200036/http://nixon.archives.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/deeded/crp-malek.php |archive-date=2010-05-31 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CRP used $500,000 in funds raised to [[1972 United States presidential election|re-elect President Nixon]] to pay legal expenses for the five Watergate burglars. This act helped turn the burglary into an explosive [[political scandal]]. The burglars, as well as [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[E. Howard Hunt]], [[John N. Mitchell]], and other Nixon administration figures, were imprisoned over the break-in and their efforts to cover it up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The acronym CREEP was derisively applied to the CRP as a nickname by Nixon's opponents; the pejorative became popular due to the Watergate scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/event/Watergate-Scandal#ref1241445 "Watergate scandal", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', by Rick Perlstein, June 10, 2019.

A '''master list of Nixon political opponents''' was compiled to supplement the original [[Nixon's Enemies List]] of 20 [[Nixon's Enemies List#People listed|key people]] considered opponents of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. The master list was compiled by [[Charles Colson]]'s office and sent in [[memorandum]] form to [[John Dean]]. Dean later provided to the [[Senate Watergate Committee]] this updated "master list" of political opponents.&lt;ref name="nytlists1973"&gt;Staff report (June 28, 1973). [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2061EFE3F5F10738DDDA10A94DE405B838BF1D3 Lists of White House 'Enemies' and Memorandums Relating to Those Named.]''[[New York Times]]'' {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219031231/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F2061EFE3F5F10738DDDA10A94DE405B838BF1D3 |date=2013-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original list split out "Black Congressmen",&lt;ref name="knappman1973"&gt;Knappman Edward W. (1973). ''Watergate and the White House.'' Facts on File, {{ISBN|978-0-87196-352-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; listing "all of the Black congressmen [and congresswomen]".&lt;ref name="welsing1973"&gt;Welsing, Frances Cress (1973). Build a World Without Racism. ''Equity &amp; Excellence in Education'', Volume 13, Issue 1 January 1973 , pages 20 - 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garza1982"&gt;Garza, Hedda (1982).

==Response==
[[Carol Channing]] stated that inclusion on the list was her greatest accomplishment.  Talk show host and journalist [[Lou Gordon (journalist)|Lou Gordon]], who was also on the list, considered his inclusion to be a "badge of honor".&lt;ref&gt;Deborah L. Gordon on DVD / Television Show "Motor City Celebrities - Lou Gordon" (c) Copyright 2008 Dream World Enterprises All Rights Reserved. [http://www.dreamworldenterprises.net/ DreamworldEnterprises.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, [[Tony Randall]] found it something he was extremely proud of, according to [[Jack Klugman]] in his memoir on Randall.

In ''[[The Great Shark Hunt]]'', [[Hunter S. Thompson]] expressed disappointment in not having been included on the list, writing "I would almost have preferred a vindictive [[tax audit]] to that kind of crippling exclusion."&lt;ref name="thompson2011"&gt;Thompson, Hunter S. (2011). ''The Great Shark Hunt: Strange Tales from a Strange Time.'' Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|9781451669251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Djerassi]]'s autobiography ''The Pill, Pigmy Chimps, and Degas' Horse'' stated that President Nixon awarded him the [[National Medal of Science]] when he was on the Enemies List. Djerassi attributed his inclusion to the fact that he was an opponent of the 
[[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.djerassi.com/J_Chem._Edu_Set-2011..pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="8227" xml:space="preserve">'''Ratfucking''' is an American [[slang]] term for political [[sabotage]] or dirty tricks. It was brought to public attention by [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] in their non-fiction book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' (1974). Woodward and Bernstein's [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]] reports that many staffers who had attended the [[University of Southern California]] ("USC")—such as [[Donald Segretti]], White House aide Tim Elbourne, [[Ronald Louis Ziegler]], [[H. R. Haldeman]], and [[Dwight Chapin]]—had participated in the highly competitive student elections there. [[UPI]] reporter Karlyn Barker sent Woodward and Bernstein a memo, "Notes On the USC Crowd", that outlined the connection.  Fraternities, sororities, and underground fraternal coordinating organizations—such as [[Theta Nu Epsilon]] and their splintered rival "Trojans for Representative Government"—engaged in creative tricks and underhanded tactics to win student elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greeninstitute.net/subpages/editor_2005-07.asp |title=Excepts from American Twilight

The tactics were either promoted by or garnered the interest of major political figures on the USC board of trustees, such as [[Dean Rusk]] and [[John A. McCone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.namebase.org/usctrust.html|title=University of Southern California Trustees (1979)|website=Namebase.org|access-date=2016-05-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120903142114/http://www.namebase.org/usctrust.html|archivedate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.namebase.org/mccone.html|title=From CIA to USC: Biography of a Trustee|website=Namebase.org|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was here that the term ''ratfucking'' had its origin.

The term received media attention in Australia after it was reported that the then Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] used the term in a tirade about China at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Marr|first=David|title=Power Trip: The political journey of Kevin Rudd (extract)|date=June 7, 2010|url=https://www.quarterlyessay.com.au/essay/2010/06/power-trip/extract|issue=38|series=Quarterly Essay|accessdate=2018-07-22|authorlink=David Marr (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.crikey.com.au/fullysic/2010/06/09/rats-from-a-sinking-summit/|title=Rats from a sinking summit - Fully (sic)|date=2010-06-09|website=Fully (sic)|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries]], candidate [[Ted Cruz]] said "[[Donald Trump|Trump]] may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him", a [[euphemism|euphemised]] reference to the term.&lt;ref name="trumprat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ted Cruz Blames Donald Trump for 'Garbage' National Enquirer Story|last1=Rhodan|first1=Maya|last2=Elliot|first2=Phillip|work=TIME|date= March 25, 2016|url=http://time.com/4272519/ted-cruz-national-enquirer-affairs-donald-trump/ |accessdate=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Donald and Melania and Heidi and Ted |author=Amy Davidson Sorkin |authorlink=Amy Davidson Sorkin |date=March 29, 2016 |magazine=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-and-melania-and-heidi-and-ted |accessdate=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August of 2017, journalist [[Marcy Wheeler]] garnered the disapprobation of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] when she used the term in a radio broadcast. Wheeler maintained that the word has become a term of art in political science and is thus not an obscenity; FCC officials disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=emptywheel |first=Marcy |last=Wheeler |number=892749028026404864 |title=I honestly thought "ratfuck" was considered a technical political term, not a modification of "fuck." |date=August 2, 2017 |accessdate=October 20, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other usages==

A more benign use of the term "ratfucking" was commonplace in Southern California (and possibly other) college slang from the late 1950s to at least the early 1960s, meaning a prank.  Around that time, [[Tony Auth]] was the cartoonist for the ''[[UCLA Daily Bruin]]''. One of his cartoons showed a large, inebriated rat suggesting to another rat, "Let's go PF-ing tonight!", a play on ratfucking or "RF-ing".  The lead story in the January 6, 1961, ''California Tech'', [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech's]] student newspaper, was headlined, "Tech Scores First Televised RF".  The article chronicled the [[Great Rose Bowl Hoax]], which had just taken place. A political context was irrelevant to such usage. At the end of the article, an Editor's Note both explained and bowdlerized:  "RF (for Royal Flush) is a contemporary college colloquialism for a clever prank."{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The term ''ratfucking'' (''rat'' in this case is shorthand for ''ration'') is a slang term used by U.S. military personnel to mean the targeted pillaging of [[MRE]]s (Meals, Ready-To-Eat), which the U.S. military calls ''field stripping''. It refers to the process of opening a case of MREs, which are packed 12 in a box, opening up individual MRE packages, removing the desired items (generally [[M&amp;M's]] and other sweets), and leaving the unenticing remainder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Phvvf-niiWUC&amp;pg=PT55&amp;lpg=PT55#v=snippet|title=Generation Kill|last1=Wright|first1=Evan|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|isbn=9781101207611|page=61|quote=The process of tearing through an MRE and picking out the goodies is called "ratfucking".

==In popular culture==
{{Notability|section|date=November 2019}}

An early use of the term (as "rat-fuck") appears in [[Edmund Wilson]]'s ''The Twenties'', in an entry dated February 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Twenties|date=1975|publisher=Farrar Straus and Giroux|page=116|authors=Wilson, Edmund &amp; Edel, Leon (Editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23rd 2019 Svetlana Lokhova filed a claim in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Stefan Halper, claiming that "Stefan Halper is a ratfucker and a spy" with a footnote that "Ratfucking" is a well-known political term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2019/05/24/cambridge-academic-news-outlets-flynn-links-1342943|title=Intelligence scholar sues Cambridge academic, U.S. news outlets over reports on Flynn links|author=Josh Gerstein|date=May 24, 2019|work=Politico.com|accessdate=2019-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used by the character [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] in season 2, episode 10, of the television show ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', after he pulled a dirty trick on his brother Chuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/better-call-saul-chuck-michael-mckean-episode.html|title=Michael McKean and Peter Gould on Chuck's Big Episode of Better Call Saul|author=Matt Zoller Seitz|authorlink=Matt Zoller Seitz|date=June 20, 2017|work=Vulture.com|accessdate=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In HBO's satire drama [[Succession (TV series)|Succession]] season 2, an individual named Sam is described as 'Ratfucker Sam' for his efforts to debunk so called rats who turn against people, hence the term by the character Logan Roy. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/succession-power-rankings-season-2-episode-3-hunting.html &lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Canuck (disambiguation)}}

The '''Canuck letter''' was a forged letter to the editor of the ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader|Manchester Union Leader]]'', published February 24, 1972, two weeks before the [[New Hampshire primary]] of the [[1972 United States presidential election]]. It implied that [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Edmund Muskie]], a candidate for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s presidential nomination, held prejudice against [[French Canadian#United States|Americans of French-Canadian descent]]. 

Reportedly the successful [[sabotage]] work of [[Donald Segretti]] and [[Ken W. Clawson]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=All the President's Men|last=Bernstein|first=Carl|last2=Woodward|first2=Bob|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2005|isbn=0-671-89441-2|location=New York|authorlink=Carl Bernstein|authorlink2=Bob Woodward|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/allpresidentsmenbern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While an affectionate term among Canadians today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6QaJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262|title=CultureShock! Canada: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette|last1=Cheng|first1=Pang Guek|last2=Barlas|first2=Robert|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd|year=2009|isbn=978-981-4435-31-4|pages=262–}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Canuck" is a term often considered derogatory when applied to Americans of French-Canadian ancestry in [[New England]]; a significant number of New Hampshire voters were of such ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/allpresidentsmenbern/page/129|title=All the President's Men|last=Bernstein|first=Carl|last2=Woodward|first2=Bob|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2005|isbn=0-671-89441-2|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/allpresidentsmenbern/page/129 129]|authorlink=Carl Bernstein|authorlink2=Bob Woodward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 1972, FBI investigators revealed that the Canuck letter was part of a [[ratfucking|dirty tricks]] campaign against Democrats orchestrated by the [[Committee to Re-Elect the President]] (CRP) (later derisively nicknamed CREEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7RoHrgX7yAC&amp;pg=PT289 |title=100 Mistakes that Changed History: Backfires and Blunders That Collapsed Empires, Crashed Economies, and Altered the Course of Our World |first=Bill |last=Fawcett |publisher=Penguin |year=2010 |page=289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter's immediate effect was to compel the candidate to give a speech in front of the newspaper's offices, subsequently known as "the crying speech".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiLL8ZAXGys The Crying Speech]&lt;/ref&gt; The letter's indirect effect was to contribute to the implosion of Muskie's candidacy.

==The crying speech==
On the morning of February 26, two Saturdays before the March 7 primary, Muskie delivered a speech in front of the offices of the ''Union Leader'', calling its publisher, [[William Loeb III|William Loeb]], a liar and lambasting him for impugning the character of Muskie's wife, [[Jane Muskie|Jane]]. Newspapers reported that Muskie cried openly: [[David Broder]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' had it that Muskie "broke down three times in as many minutes"; [[David Nyhan]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' had Muskie "weeping silently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-03-08/news/26220294_1_ed-muskie-manchester-union-leader-tears|title=Muskie's 'Tears' How The Press' Perception Can Change History|first=David B.|last=Wilson|date=March 8, 1987|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' showed Muskie's face contorted with emotion. Muskie maintained that if his voice cracked, it cracked from anger; Muskie's antagonist was the same editor who referred to him in the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 election]] as "Moscow Muskie", and called him a [[flip-flop (politics)|flip-flopper]]. The tears, Muskie claimed, were actually snow melting on his face. Jim Naughton of ''[[The New York Times]]'', standing immediately at Muskie's feet, could not confirm that Muskie cried.

==Denunciation==
Whether true or false, fear of Muskie's alleged unstable emotional condition led some New Hampshire Democrats to defect to [[George McGovern]]. Muskie's winning margin, 46% to McGovern's 37%, was smaller than his campaign had predicted. The bounce and second-place finish led the McGovern campaign to boast of its momentum. By the time of the Florida primary, with McGovern clearing other left-leaning candidates from the field, Muskie's campaign was dead.

''Washington Post'' staff writer [[Marilyn Berger]] reported that Nixon White House staffer [[Ken W. Clawson|Ken Clawson]] had bragged to her about authoring the letter. Clawson denied Berger's account. In October 1972, FBI investigators asserted that the Canuck Letter was part of the dirty tricks campaign against Democrats orchestrated by the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CREEP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =Woodward  | first = Bob |author2=Bernstein, Carl  | title = FBI Finds Nixon Aides Sabotaged Democrats | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/101072-1.htm | website = Washington Post | date = October 10, 1972  | accessdate = September 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb, the publisher of the ''Manchester Union Leader'', maintained that the letter was not a fabrication, but later admitted to having some doubt, however, after receiving another letter claiming that someone had been paid $1,000 to write the Canuck Letter. The purported author, Paul Morrison of [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]], was never found.

The authorship of the letter is covered at length in the 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' by [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] and its [[All the President's Men (film)|1976 film adaptation]].

The '''pardon of Richard Nixon''' (formally known as '''Proclamation 4311''') was a [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|presidential proclamation]] issued by [[President of the United States]] [[Gerald Ford]] on September 8, 1974. By it, Ford granted to [[Richard Nixon]], his predecessor, a full and unconditional [[pardon]] for any crimes that he might have committed against the [[United States]] as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Gerald |date=September 8, 1974 |url=https://fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/speeches/740061.asp|title=President Gerald R.

In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford, who had succeeded to the presidency upon Nixon's resignation, explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country and that the Nixon family's situation was "a tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must."&lt;ref name="pardonspeech2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ford |first=Gerald |date= September 8, 1974 |url=http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/ford.htm|title=Gerald R.

After Ford left the White House in 1977, he privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of ''[[Burdick v. United States]]'', a 1915 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision that suggested that a pardon carries an imputation of guilt and that its acceptance carries a confession of guilt.&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt;&lt;ref name="five_myths_2018_06_07_chicago_tribune"&gt;Kalt, Brian C.

== Pardon ==

Following the release of [[Nixon White House tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|the "smoking gun" tape]] on August 5, 1974, Nixon's position had become untenable. In his autobiography, ''A Time to Heal'', Ford wrote about a meeting he had with [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] before Nixon's resignation. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon's staff thought were Nixon's only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process to try to settle for a censure vote in Congress or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon's staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him. On this subject, Ford wrote:

{{quote|Haig emphasized that these weren't ''his'' suggestions. He didn't identify the staff members and he made it very clear that he wasn't recommending any one option over another. What he wanted to know was whether or not my overall assessment of the situation agreed with his.... [emphasis in original] Next he asked if I had any suggestions as to courses of actions for the President. I didn't think it would be proper for me to make any recommendations at all, and I told him so.&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1979), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a ''[[Washington Post]]'' story published the night Ford died, journalist [[Bob Woodward]] said that Ford once told Woodward he decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship that Ford and Nixon shared.&lt;ref name="shanescott"&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott |last=Shane |title=For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/washington/29pardon.html|work=The New York Times|page=A1 |accessdate=September 8, 2009 | date=December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, the Nixons flew to their home [[La Casa Pacifica]] in [[San Clemente, California]].{{sfn|Nixon Library, Post Presidency}} According to his biographer, [[Jonathan Aitken]], after his resignation, "Nixon was a soul in torment."{{sfn|Aitken|p=529}}&lt;!-- ''not'' a full sentence in original, thus period outside quotation marks --&gt; Congress had funded Nixon's transition costs, including some salary expenses but reduced the appropriation from $850,000 to $200,000. With some of his staff still with him, Nixon was at his desk by 7&amp;nbsp;a.m. with little to do.{{sfn|Aitken|p=529}} His former press secretary, [[Ron Ziegler]], sat with him alone for hours each day.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=529–30}}

Nixon's resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished. The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon, but it would be unpopular in the country. Nixon, contacted by Ford emissaries, was initially reluctant to accept the pardon but then agreed to do so. Ford, however, insisted on a statement of contrition; Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document. Ford eventually agreed, and on September 8, 1974, he granted Nixon a "full, free, and absolute pardon" that ended any possibility of an indictment. Nixon then released a statement:

{{quote | I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy. No words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over Watergate have caused the nation and the presidency, a nation I so deeply love, and an institution I so greatly respect.&lt;ref name="nixon_statement_1974_09_09_ny_times"&gt;Nixon, Richard Milhous, statement, in: [https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/09/archives/the-statement-by-nixon-pr.html "The Statement by Nixon," ] transcript, September 9, 1974, ''[[New York Times]],'' retrieved February 14, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aitken|p=532}}{{sfn|Black|p=990}}}}

== Public response ==

The Nixon pardon was controversial. Critics derided the move and claimed a "[[corrupt bargain]]" had been struck between the men: that Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation, elevating Ford to the presidency. Ford's first press secretary and close friend [[Jerald terHorst]] resigned his post in protest after the pardon.

The Nixon pardon was a pivotal moment in the [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|Ford presidency]]. 
Historians believe that the controversy was one of the major reasons that Ford lost the [[1976 United States presidential election|election in 1976]], and Ford agreed with that observation.&lt;ref name="shanescott"/&gt; In an editorial at the time, ''The New York Times'' stated that the Nixon pardon was a "profoundly unwise, divisive, and unjust act" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's "credibility as a man of judgment, candor, and competence". Allegations of a secret deal made with Ford, promising a pardon in return for Nixon's resignation, led Ford to testify before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] on October 17, 1974.&lt;ref name="Gettlin, Robert; Colodny, Len 1991 420"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Gettlin, Robert| author2=Colodny, Len| title=Silent Coup: The Removal of a President| publisher=St. Martin's Press| location=New York| year=1991| page=[https://archive.org/details/silentcoupremova00colo/page/420 420]| isbn=0-312-05156-5| oclc=22493143| url=https://archive.org/details/silentcoupremova00colo/page/420}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ford, Gerald R.| title = A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R.

In October 1974, Nixon fell ill with [[phlebitis]]. Told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die, a reluctant Nixon chose surgery, and Ford visited him in the hospital. Nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aides ([[John Dean]], [[H. R. Haldeman]], and [[John Ehrlichman]]) and ''The Washington Post'', disbelieving his illness, printed a cartoon showing Nixon with a cast on the "wrong foot." Judge [[John Sirica]] excused Nixon's presence despite the defendants' objections.{{sfn|Aitken|pp=533–34}} Congress instructed Ford to retain Nixon's presidential papers, which began a three-decade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate.{{sfn|Black|pp=994, 999}} Nixon was in the hospital when the [[1974 United States elections|1974 midterm elections]] were held, and Watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the Republican loss of 43&amp;nbsp;seats in the House and three in the Senate.{{sfn|Black|p=998}} Two years later, lingering public resentment over the pardon was a factor in Ford's narrow loss to Democratic Party nominee [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=van der Voort| first=Tom| title=Watergate: The Aftermath| url=https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/watergate/watergate-aftermath| work=The Presidency Educational Resources| publisher=The Miller Center, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=January 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''inauguration of Gerald Ford''' as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|38th]] [[President of the United States]] was held on Friday, August 9, 1974, in the [[East Room]] of the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web |author = [[Architect of the Capitol]] |date = n.d. |title = Presidential Oaths of Office |url = http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pioaths.html |publisher = [[Library of Congress]] |access-date = February 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Watergate scandal|the resignation of President Richard Nixon]]. The [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] marked the commencement of [[Gerald Ford]]'s only term (a partial term of {{age in years and days|1974|8|9|1977|1|20}}) as President. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger]] administered the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]]. The [[Bible]] upon which Ford recited the oath was held by his wife, [[Betty Ford]], open to Proverbs 3:5-6.&lt;ref name="JCCIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/swearing-in-of-vice-president-gerald-r-ford-after-the-resignation-of-president-richard-m-nixon|title=The swearing in of Gerald R. Ford, August 09, 1974|publisher=U.S. Senate|access-date=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was the ninth vice president to succeed to the presidency intra-term, and he remains the most recent to do so.

Although the ninth non-scheduled, extraordinary inauguration to take place since the presidency was established in 1789, it was the first to take place because the [[incumbent]] had resigned from office.  Ford had become Vice President on December 6, 1973, after the resignation of [[Spiro Agnew]]. He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]]. Thus, when he succeeded Nixon, Ford became the first (and remains the only) person to have held both the office of Vice President and President without having been elected to either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment25/ |via = FindLaw |work = U.S. Constitution |title = Twenty-Fifth Amendment }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = United States Congress Joint Committee on Printing |title = Memorial Services in the Congress of the United States and Tributes in Eulogy of Gerald R.

==Nixon's farewell==

In a televised [[Oval Office]] [[Richard Nixon's resignation speech|speech]] on August 8, 1974, [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]], who was facing [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment proceedings]] for his role in the [[Watergate scandal]] and alleged cover-up,&lt;ref name="JCCIC"/&gt; announced to the nation that he would resign the [[President of the United States|Presidency of the United States]] "effective at noon tomorrow [August 9]."&lt;ref name=NixonResignationSpeech&gt;{{cite web |last = Nixon |first = Richard |url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/links/nixon_speech.html |title = President Nixon's Resignation Speech |date = August 8, 1974 |via = [[PBS]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 9:00&amp;nbsp;am the following morning, Nixon gave a farewell talk to an [[East Room]] assembly of White House staff and selected dignitaries, including the Cabinet and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Ford. It was an emotional event, with President Nixon nearly breaking down a number of times. When it was finished, Vice President Ford escorted the President and [[Pat Nixon|First Lady]] to an Army helicopter, where the President waved his famous "v-sign" before flying off to [[Air Force One]] and a flight to "exile" in California. The [[nuclear football|nuclear codes]] were left with Ford.

==Ford's swearing-in==
Nixon's resignation was tendered to [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] at 11:35&amp;nbsp;am. At that moment, Ford became the 38th President of the United States, although he took the official [[oath of office]] at 12:05&amp;nbsp;pm. Once the former President (and now private citizen)  Nixon left the building, the White House staff began preparations for Ford's swearing in. More chairs were added for the much larger crowd of invited guests than was at the farewell. The oath was administered to Ford by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren Burger]] in the [[White House]] [[East Room]]. Chief Justice Burger was traveling in the Netherlands at the time, and was flown back to Washington on an Air Force plane.&lt;ref name=Cannon /&gt; The first phone call that President Ford, a former center on the [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan football]] team, made after his inauguration was on Saturday, August 10, 1974, to [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State University football]] coach [[Woody Hayes]], who had just recently suffered a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Old Michigan Man Rings Up Woody |work = [[The Washington Post]] |date = August 23, 1974 |page = D3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remarks upon swearing-in==
Immediately after taking the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath]], Ford gave a speech (authored by [[Counselor to the President]] [[Robert T. Hartmann]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dennis Hevesi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/19/us/politics/19hartmann.html?_r=0 |title=Robert Hartmann, 91, Dies; Wrote Ford's Noted Talk |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 19, 2008 |accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; alluding in his remarks to the unique and [[Watergate scandal|"extraordinary circumstances"]] that led to his ascension to the presidency:

{{quote|text=I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your President by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your President with your prayers. And I hope that such prayers will also be the first of many ... If you have not chosen me by secret ballot, neither have I gained office by any secret promises. I have not campaigned either for the Presidency or the Vice Presidency. I have not subscribed to any partisan platform. I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman—my dear wife, [[Betty Ford|Betty]]—as I begin this very difficult job ... My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over ... Our [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule. But there is a higher Power, by whatever name we honor him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy.|sign=[[Gerald Ford]]|source=Swearing-in Ceremony speech&lt;ref name=speech&gt;{{cite web |last = Ford |first = Gerald |date = August 9, 1974 |title = Swearing-in Ceremony |work = President's Speeches and Statements |url = http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0122/1252055.pdf |publisher = [[Gerald R.

Immediately after the 850-word address was over, Ford introduced his new press secretary, [[Jerald terHorst]] to the press corps, and met with the Cabinet.

'''Daniel Ellsberg''' (born April 7, 1931) is an American economist, activist and former [[United States military]] analyst who, while employed by the [[RAND Corporation]], precipitated a national political controversy in 1971 when he released the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'', a top-secret [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] study of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] decision-making in relation to the [[Vietnam War]], to ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other newspapers. 

On January 3, 1973, Ellsberg was charged under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] along with other charges of theft and conspiracy, carrying a total maximum sentence of 115 years. Due to governmental misconduct and illegal evidence-gathering, and the defense by [[Leonard Boudin]] and Harvard Law School professor [[Charles Nesson]], [[William Matthew Byrne, Jr.|Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr.]] dismissed all charges against Ellsberg on May 11, 1973.

Ellsberg was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] in 2006. He is also known for having formulated an important example in [[decision theory]], the [[Ellsberg paradox]], his extensive studies on [[nuclear weapons]] and [[Nuclear weapons of the United States|nuclear policy]], and for having voiced support for [[WikiLeaks]], [[Chelsea Manning]], and [[Edward Snowden]].

Ellsberg was awarded the 2018 [[Olof Palme Prize]] for his "profound humanism and exceptional moral courage."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.palmefonden.se/2018-daniel-ellsberg-2/|title=2018 – Daniel Ellsberg {{!}} OLOF PALMES MINNESFOND|language=sv-SE|access-date=2019-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Ellsberg was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], on April 7, 1931, the son of Harry and Adele (Charsky) Ellsberg. His parents were [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who had converted to [[Christian Science]], and he was raised as a Christian Scientist. He grew up in [[Detroit]] and attended the [[Cranbrook Kingswood School|Cranbrook School]] in nearby [[Bloomfield Hills]]. His mother wanted him to be a [[concert pianist]], but he stopped playing in July 1946, after both his mother and sister were killed when his father fell asleep at the wheel and crashed the family car into a [[culvert]] wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ml_ZepYWGdkC&amp;pg=PA36|title=Wild Man: The Life and Times of Daniel Ellsberg|first=Tom|last=Wells|date=June 9, 2001|pages=36, 39, 70–95, 267|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|via=Google Books|isbn=9780312177195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellsberg entered [[Harvard College]] on a scholarship, graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' with an [[A.B.]] in [[economics]] in 1952. He studied at the [[University of Cambridge]] for a year on a [[Woodrow Wilson]] [[Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation|Fellowship]], then returned to Harvard for graduate school. In 1954, he enlisted in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and earned a commission.&lt;ref name=bookragsbio/&gt; He served as a platoon leader and company commander in the 2nd Marine Division, and was discharged in 1957 as a [[first lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=bookragsbio/&gt; Ellsberg returned to Harvard as a Junior Fellow in the [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Society of Fellows]] for two years.&lt;ref name=bookragsbio/&gt;

==RAND Corporation and PhD==
Ellsberg began working as a strategic analyst at the [[RAND Corporation]] for the summer of 1958 and then permanently in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode
 | title = Daniel Ellsberg Explains Why He Leaked The Pentagon Papers
 | url = https://www.npr.org/2018/01/19/579101965/daniel-ellsberg-explains-why-he-leaked-the-pentagon-papers | series = Fresh Air | series-link = Fresh Air

Ellsberg completed a [[Ph.D.]] in economics from Harvard in 1962.&lt;ref name=bookragsbio&gt;Daniel Ellsberg Biography @ Encyclopedia of World Biography, via [http://www.bookrags.com/biography/daniel-ellsberg BookRags.com]&lt;/ref&gt; His dissertation on [[decision theory]] was based on a set of thought experiments that showed that decisions under conditions of [[uncertainty]] or [[ambiguity]] generally may not be consistent with well defined subjective probabilities. Now known as the [[Ellsberg paradox]],&lt;ref name=Ellsberg1961&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ellsberg|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Ellsberg|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]|volume=75|title=Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms|year=1961|pages=643–669 |doi=10.2307/1884324|issue=4 |jstor=1884324 |url=http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs47605.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; this formed the basis of a large literature that has developed since the 1980s, including approaches such as [[Choquet expected utility]] and [[info-gap decision theory]].

Ellsberg worked in the Pentagon from August 1964&lt;ref name=BBC4&gt;[[BBC Four]] ''[[Storyville (television series)|Storyville]] – 2009–2010 – 14. The Most Dangerous Man in America''&lt;/ref&gt; under [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] as special assistant to Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs [[John McNaughton (government official)|John McNaughton]]. [At this point of Lyndon Johnson's escalation into the Vietnam War, Ellsberg would later discover the lies and subsequent cover-up of the "non-attacks" upon our U.S. ship, Maddox, in the Gulf of Tonken ("by North Vietnam"), which led to our uncalled-for bombing raids into North Vietnam on August 2nd and 4th, 1964, under orders by President Lyndon B. Johnson. This unprovoked attack upon North Vietnam came right on the heels of Senator Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign statement where he basically stated that Johnson was soft on Communism, "no matter where it is!"  Lyndon Johnson's political stunt could have brought the Chinese Military directly into this war.] [7a]

He then went to [[South Vietnam]] for two years, working for General [[Edward Lansdale]] as a member of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].

On his return from South Vietnam, Ellsberg resumed working at RAND. In 1967, he contributed to a top-secret study of [[Classified information|classified]] documents on the conduct of the Vietnam War that had been commissioned by Defense Secretary McNamara.&lt;ref name=upi1971yearinreview&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pentagon Papers|work=1971 Year in Review|publisher=UPI|year=1971|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/The-Pentagon-Papers/12295509436546-7|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents, completed in 1968, later became known collectively as the Pentagon Papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/movie/FIjiysnlYYSwnm/REqtSvvuifNltz |title=The Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers (2010) |publisher=Movieweb.com |accessdate=December 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125071147/http://www.movieweb.com/movie/FIjiysnlYYSwnm/REqtSvvuifNltz |archive-date=January 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through study of this body of US government records, Ellsberg came to understand about the Vietnam War that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was no more a "[[civil war]]" after 1955 or 1960 than it had been during the U.S.-supported French attempt at colonial reconquest. A war in which one side was ''entirely'' equipped and paid by a foreign power – which dictated the nature of the local regime in its own interest – was not a civil war. To say that we had "interfered" in what is "really a civil war," as most American academic writers and even liberal critics of the war do to this day, simply screened a more painful reality and was as much a myth as the earlier official one of "aggression from the North." In terms of the [[UN Charter]] and of our own avowed ideals, it was a war of foreign aggression, American aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Oliver and Kuznick, Peter, "The Untold History of the United States" (New York: Gallery Books, 2012) p. 384 ''citing'' Daniel Ellberg, "Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers" (New York: Viking, 2002), pp. 258–260&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disaffection with Vietnam War==
By 1969, Ellsberg began attending [[anti-war]] events while still remaining in his position at RAND. In April 1968, Ellsberg attended a Princeton conference on “Revolution in a Changing World,” where he met Gandhian peace activist [[Janaki Tschannerl]] from India, who had a profound influence on him, and [[Eqbal Ahmed]], a Pakistani fellow at the Adlai Stevenson Institute later to be indicted with Rev. [[Philip Berrigan]] for anti-war activism.  Ellsberg particularly recalls Tschannerl saying “In my world, there are no enemies”, and that “she gave me a vision, as a Gandhian, of a different way of living and resistance, of exercising power nonviolently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lukas |first1=J. Anthony |title=After the Pentagon Papers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/12/archives/a-month-in-the-new-life-of-daniel-ellsberg-the-new-life-of-daniel.html |accessdate=5 July 2019 |work=New York Times |date=12 Dec 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

He experienced an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] attending a [[War Resisters League]] conference at [[Haverford College]] in August 1969, listening to a speech given by a [[draft resister]] named [[Randy Kehler]], who said he was "very excited" that he would soon be able to join his friends in prison.&lt;ref name="thomas2002"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Thomas|first = Marlo|authorlink = Marlo Thomas|title = The Right Words at the Right Time|publisher = Atria Books|year = 2002|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-7862-8889-2|display-authors = etal|url = https://archive.org/details/rightwordsatrigh0000thom}} pp.100–03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyp.is/M4GAugGYEei1At-CibjmnQ/janksreviews.com/post-indepth-review/|title=The Post – In-Depth Review|last=Farrow|first=Chas|date=|website=|access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ellsberg described his reaction:{{quote|And he said this very calmly. I hadn't known that he was about to be sentenced for draft resistance. It hit me as a total surprise and shock, because I heard his words in the midst of actually feeling proud of my country listening to him. And then I heard he was going to prison. It wasn't what he said exactly that changed my worldview. It was the example he was setting with his life. How his words in general showed that he was a stellar American, and that he was going to jail as a very deliberate choice—because he thought it was the right thing to do. There was no question in my mind that my government was involved in an unjust war that was going to continue and get larger. Thousands of young men were dying each year. I left the auditorium and found a deserted men's room. I sat on the floor and cried for over an hour, just sobbing. The only time in my life I've reacted to something like that.}}

Decades later, reflecting on Kehler's decision, Ellsberg said:{{quote|Randy Kehler never thought his going to prison would end the war. If I hadn't met Randy Kehler it wouldn't have occurred to me to copy [the Pentagon Papers]. His actions spoke to me as no mere words would have done. He put the right question in my mind at the right time.}}

After leaving RAND, Ellsberg was employed as a senior research associate at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Center for International Studies from 1970 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/09/archives/daniel-ellsberg-of-mit-marries-patricia-marx.html|title=Daniel Ellsberg of M.I.T.

==The ''Pentagon Papers''==
{{Main|Pentagon Papers}}
In late 1969, with the assistance of his former RAND Corporation colleague [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]], Ellsberg secretly made several sets of photocopies of the classified documents to which he had access; these later became known as the ''Pentagon Papers''. They revealed that, early on, the government had knowledge that the war as then resourced could most likely not be won. Further, as an editor of ''The New York Times'' was to write much later, these documents "demonstrated, among other things, that the [[Lyndon B. Johnson#Presidency 1963–1969|Johnson Administration]] had systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress, about a subject of transcendent national interest and significance".&lt;ref name="Apple"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Apple|first=R.W.|authorlink=R. W. Apple, Jr.|title=Pentagon Papers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York|date=June 23, 1996|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/pentagon_papers/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=pentagon%20papers&amp;st=cse|quote=Johnson Administration had systematically lied, not only to the public but also to Congress|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Ellsberg copied the documents, he resolved to meet some of the people who had influenced both his change of heart on the war and his decision to act. One of them was Randy Kehler. Another was the poet [[Gary Snyder]], whom he had met in Kyoto in 1960, and with whom he had argued about U.S. foreign policy; Ellsberg was finally prepared to concede that Gary Snyder had been right, about both the situation and the need for action against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Halper|first=Jon|title=Gary Snyder: dimensions of a life|publisher=Sierra Club Books|year=1991|isbn=978-0-87156-636-2|url=https://archive.org/details/garysnyderdimens00halp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release and publication===
Throughout 1970, Ellsberg covertly attempted to persuade a few sympathetic [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]]—among them [[J. William Fulbright]], chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], and [[George McGovern]], a leading opponent of the war—to release the papers on the Senate floor, because a Senator could not be prosecuted for anything he said on the record before the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford J. Ungar, The Papers &amp; The Papers, An Account of the Legal and Political Battle Over the Pentagon Papers, 1972, E.P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc., New York; p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellsberg allowed some copies of the documents to circulate privately, including among scholars at the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] (IPS). Ellsberg also shared the documents with ''The New York Times'' correspondent [[Neil Sheehan]], who wrote a story based on what he had received both directly from Ellsberg and from contacts at IPS.&lt;ref name=wildmanreviewinreason&gt;{{Cite news|last=Young |first=Michael |title=The devil and Daniel Ellsberg: From archetype to anachronism (review of ''Wild Man: The Life and Times of Daniel Ellsberg'') |newspaper=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |page=2 |date=June 2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_2_34/ai_85701104 |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830070005/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_2_34/ai_85701104/ |archivedate=August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, June 13, 1971, the ''Times'' published the first of nine excerpts from, and commentaries on, the 7,000 page collection. For 15 days, the ''Times'' was prevented from publishing its articles by court order requested by the Nixon administration. Meanwhile, while eluding an [[FBI]] manhunt for thirteen days, Ellsberg leaked the documents to ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers|journal=The Nation|author=H. Bruce Franklin|date=July 9, 2001|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/ELLSBERG.htm|access-date=July 15, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509054438/http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/ELLSBERG.htm|archive-date=May 9, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, the [[US Supreme Court]] ordered free resumption of publication by the ''Times'' (''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]''). Two days prior to the Supreme Court's decision, Ellsberg publicly admitted his role in releasing the Pentagon Papers to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ellsberg|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Ellsberg|title=Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|year=2002|isbn=978-0-670-03030-9|url=https://archive.org/details/secretsmemoirofv02ells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 1971, U.S. Senator [[Mike Gravel]] of Alaska entered 4,100 pages of the Papers into the record of his Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds—pages which he had received from Ellsberg via [[Ben Bagdikian]], then an editor at the ''Washington Post''.

===Fallout===
The release of these papers was politically embarrassing not only to those involved in the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] administrations, but also to the incumbent Nixon administration. Nixon's [[Watergate tapes|Oval Office tape]] from June 14, 1971, shows [[H. R. Haldeman]] describing the situation to Nixon:

[[File:Nixon Oval Office meeting with H.R. Haldeman, Monday, 14 June 1971, 309 p.m.wav|thumb|Nixon Oval Office meeting with H.R. Haldeman, Monday, 14 June 1971, 3:09 p.m. . (Quote begins at about 7:30 into the recording) [http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/oval.pdf Transcript here] ]]
:[[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]] was making this point this morning... To the ordinary guy, all this is a bunch of gobbledygook. But out of the gobbledygook comes a very clear thing.... You can't trust the government; you can't believe what they say; and you can't rely on their judgment; and the – the implicit infallibility of presidents, which has been an accepted thing in America, is badly hurt by this, because It shows that people do things the president wants to do even though it's wrong, and the president can be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Meadows|first = Eddie|authorlink = |title = Oval office meeting with Bob Haldelman, Nixon Presidential Materials Project, Oval-519-, Cassette 747|newspaper = audio tape|location = |date = June 14, 1971|url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/nixon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], Nixon's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], almost immediately issued a telegram to the ''Times'' ordering that it halt publication. The ''Times'' refused, and the government brought suit against it.

Although the ''Times'' eventually won the case before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], prior to that, an [[appellate court]] ordered that the ''Times'' temporarily halt further publication. This was the first time the federal government was able to restrain the publication of a major newspaper since the presidency of [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[U.S. Civil War]]. Ellsberg released the Pentagon Papers to seventeen other newspapers in rapid succession.&lt;ref&gt;''The Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers''&lt;/ref&gt; The right of the press to publish the papers was upheld in ''[[New York Times Co. v.

In response to the leaks, Nixon White House staffers began a campaign against further leaks and against Ellsberg personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/12-9-2002-31884.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712153748/http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/12-9-2002-31884.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |title=Portrait: Daniel Ellsberg |publisher=Buzzle.com |date=December 9, 2002 |accessdate=December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aides [[Egil Krogh]] and [[David Young (Watergate)|David Young]], under the supervision of [[John Ehrlichman]], created the "[[White House Plumbers]]", which would later lead to the Watergate burglaries. [[Richard Holbrooke]], a friend of Ellsberg, came to see him as "one of those accidental characters of history who show the pattern of a whole era" and thought that he was the "triggering mechanism for events which would link Vietnam and Watergate in one continuous 1961-to-1975 story."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Our Man : Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century|last=Packer|first=George|publisher=KNOPF|year=2019|isbn=9780307958037|location=NY|pages=145|oclc=1043051114}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Fielding break-in==
[[File:Daniel Ellsberg psychiatrist filing cabinet.jpg|thumb|Fielding's filing cabinet, with break-in marks, on display at the [[Smithsonian National Museum of American History]]]]
In August 1971, Krogh and Young met with [[G. Gordon Liddy]] and [[E. Howard Hunt]] in a basement office in the [[Old Executive Office Building]]. Hunt and Liddy recommended a "covert operation" to get a "mother lode" of information about Ellsberg's mental state in order to discredit him. Krogh and Young sent a memo to Ehrlichman seeking his approval for a "covert operation [to] be undertaken to examine all of the medical files still held by Ellsberg's psychiatrist", Lewis Fielding. Ehrlichman approved under the condition that it be "done under your assurance that it is not traceable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/30/opinion/30krogh.html|first=Egil|last=Krogh|authorlink=Egil Krogh|title=The Break-In That History Forgot|journal=The New York Times|date=June 30, 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 1971, the burglary of Fielding's office—titled "Hunt/Liddy Special Project No. 1" in Ehrlichman's notes—was carried out by [[White House Plumbers]] Hunt, Liddy, [[Eugenio Martínez]], Felipe de Diego and [[Bernard Barker]] (the latter three were, or had been, recruited CIA agents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/325566/united-states-v-felipe-de-diego/ |title=United States v. Felipe de Diego, 511 F.2d 818 |website=CourtListener.com |publisher=[[Free Law Project]] |year=1975 |accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Plumbers found Ellsberg's file, but it apparently did not contain the potentially embarrassing information they sought, as they left it discarded on the floor of Fielding's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hougan, Jim |title=Secret Agenda |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-394-51428-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/secretagendawate00houg |author-link=Jim Hougan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt and Liddy subsequently planned to break into Fielding's home, but Ehrlichman did not approve the second burglary. The break-in was not known to Ellsberg or to the public until it came to light during Ellsberg and Russo's trial in April 1973.

==Trial and dismissal==
On June 28, 1971, two days before a [[New York Times Co. v. United States|Supreme Court ruling]] saying that a federal judge had ruled incorrectly about the right of ''The New York Times'' to publish the Pentagon Papers,&lt;ref name=upi1971yearinreview/&gt; Ellsberg publicly surrendered to the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts]] in [[Boston]]. In admitting to giving the documents to the press, Ellsberg said:
:I felt that as an American citizen, as a responsible citizen, I could no longer cooperate in concealing this information from the American public. I did this clearly at my own jeopardy and I am prepared to answer to all the consequences of this decision.&lt;ref name=upi1971yearinreview/&gt;
He and Russo faced charges under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and other charges including theft and conspiracy, carrying a total maximum sentence of 115 years for Ellsberg, 35 years for Russo. Their trial commenced in Los Angeles on January 3, 1973, presided over by U.S. District Judge [[William Matthew Byrne Jr.]] Ellsberg tried to claim that the documents were ''illegally'' classified to keep them not from an enemy but from the American public.  However, that argument was ruled "irrelevant".  Ellsberg was silenced before he could begin.  Ellsberg said, in 2014, that his "lawyer, exasperated, said he 'had never heard of a case where a defendant was not permitted to tell the jury why he did what he did.' The judge responded: 'Well, you're hearing one now'. And so it has been with every subsequent whistleblower under indictment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ellsberg | first = Daniel

In spite of being effectively denied a defense, Ellsberg began to see events turn in his favor when the break-in of Fielding's office was revealed to Judge Byrne in a memo on April 26;  Byrne ordered it to be shared with the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,907160,00.html|journal=Time|date=May 7, 1973|title=Practicing on Ellsberg|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=byrneobit&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/14/AR2006011401165.html|title=Judge William Byrne; Ended Trial Over Pentagon Papers|journal=Washington Post|date=January 15, 2006|pages=C09|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, further evidence of illegal wiretapping against Ellsberg was revealed in court. The FBI had recorded numerous conversations between [[Morton Halperin]] and Ellsberg without a [[court order]], and furthermore the prosecution had failed to share this evidence with the defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx "''The Pentagon Papers''"] by John T. Correll, ''Air Force Magazine'', February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Byrne also revealed that he personally met twice with John Ehrlichman, who offered him directorship of the FBI. Byrne said he refused to consider the offer while the Ellsberg case was pending, though he was criticized for even agreeing to meet with Ehrlichman during the case.&lt;ref name=byrneobit/&gt;

Due to the gross governmental misconduct and illegal evidence gathering, and the defense by [[Leonard Boudin]] and [[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Charles Nesson]], Judge Byrne dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and Russo on May 11, 1973 after the government claimed it had lost records of wiretapping against Ellsberg. Byrne ruled: "The totality of the circumstances of this case which I have only briefly sketched offend a sense of justice. The bizarre events have incurably infected the prosecution of this case."&lt;ref name=byrneobit/&gt;

As a result of the revelations involving the Watergate scandal, [[John Ehrlichman]], [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[Richard Kleindienst]], and [[John Dean]] were forced out of office on April 30, and all would later be convicted of crimes related to [[Watergate]]. Egil Krogh later pleaded guilty to conspiracy, and White House counsel [[Charles Colson]] pleaded no contest for obstruction of justice in the burglary.

===Halperin case===
It was also revealed in 1973, during Ellsberg's trial, that the telephone calls of [[Morton Halperin]], a member of the [[U.S. National Security Council]] staff suspected of leaking information about the secret bombing of Cambodia to ''The New York Times'', were being recorded by the FBI at the request of [[Henry Kissinger]] to [[J. Edgar Hoover]].

Halperin and his family sued several federal officials, claiming the wiretap violated their [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights and Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The court agreed that Richard Nixon, John Mitchell, and H. R. Haldeman had violated the Halperins' Fourth Amendment rights and awarded them $1 in nominal damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/606/f2d/1192#fn4_ref Halperin v. Kissinger] 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plumbers' Ellsberg neutralization proposal===
Ellsberg later claimed that after his trial ended, Watergate prosecutor [[William H. Merrill]] informed him of an aborted plot by Liddy and the "[[White House Plumbers|Plumbers]]" to have 12 [[Cuban American]]s who had previously worked for the CIA "totally incapacitate" Ellsberg when he appeared at a public rally. It is unclear whether they were meant to assassinate Ellsberg or merely to hospitalize him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2006/4/27/exclusive_nixon_white_house_counsel_john|title=Nixon White House Counsel John Dean and Pentagon Papers Leaker Daniel Ellsberg on Watergate and the Abuse of Presidential Power from Nixon to Bush|date=April 27, 2006|journal=Democracy Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/guides/debate/chats/ellsberg/ |title=COLD WAR Chat: Daniel Ellsberg, Anti-war activist |date=January 10, 1999 |journal=Cold War |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219071852/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/guides/debate/chats/ellsberg/ |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Liddy describes an "Ellsberg neutralization proposal" originating from Howard Hunt, which involved drugging Ellsberg with [[LSD]], by dissolving it in his soup, at a fund-raising dinner in Washington in order to "have Ellsberg incoherent by the time he was to speak" and thus "make him appear a near burnt-out drug case" and "discredit him." The plot involved waiters from the Miami Cuban community. According to Liddy, when the plan was finally approved, "there was no longer enough lead time to get the Cuban waiters up from their Miami hotels and into place in the Washington Hotel where the dinner was to take place" and the plan was "put into abeyance pending another opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Will: The Autobiography of G.

==Later activism and views==
[[File:Ellsberg.ogv|thumb|Video interview with Daniel Ellsberg at [[Roskilde Universitets Center]], Denmark, 2004-10-26. (Unedited, the first 10 seconds are black.)]]
Since the end of the Vietnam War, Ellsberg has continued his [[Activism|political activism]], giving lecture tours and speaking out about current events. Reflecting on his time in government, Ellsberg has said the following, based on his extensive access to classified material:

:The public is lied to every day by the President, by his spokespeople, by his officers. If you can't handle the thought that the President lies to the public for all kinds of reasons, you couldn't stay in the government at that level, or you're made aware of it, a week. ... The fact is Presidents rarely say the whole truth—essentially, never say the whole truth—of what they expect and what they're doing and what they believe and why they're doing it and rarely refrain from lying, actually, about these matters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y2wmpxM2VQ "Presidential Decisions and Public Dissent"], ''Conversations with History'', July 29, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-war activism===
In an interview with ''[[Democracy Now]]'' on May 18, 2018, Ellsberg was critical of U.S. intervention overseas especially in the Middle East, stating, "I think, in Iraq, America has never faced up to the number of people who have died because of our invasion, our aggression against Iraq, and Afghanistan over the last 30 years, since we first inspired a CIA-sponsored jihad against the Soviets there, and led to the invasion by the Soviets. What we've done to the Middle East has been hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/5/18/whistleblower_daniel_ellsberg_civil_disobedience_against|title=Whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg: Civil Disobedience Against Vietnam War Led Me to Leak Pentagon Papers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Activism against US-led war against Iraq====
[[File:DanielEllsberg.THF.WH.WDC.3jul06.jpg|thumb|Protesting with anti-war group [[Code Pink]] in 2006]]
During the runup to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] he warned of a possible "[[Gulf of Tonkin incident|Tonkin Gulf scenario]]" that could be used to justify going to war, and called on government "insiders" to go public with information to counter the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration's]] [[Public relations preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq|pro-war propaganda campaign]], praising [[Scott Ritter]] for his efforts in that regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://logosonline.home.igc.org/ellsberg.pdf|title=IGC.org|access-date=December 8, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218011104/http://logosonline.home.igc.org/ellsberg.pdf|archive-date=December 18, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later supported the whistleblowing efforts of British [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] translator [[Katharine Gun]] and called on others to leak any papers that reveal government deception about the invasion.&lt;ref name="expertwitnessradio.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expertwitnessradio.org/archives/ellsberg.html |title=The Expert Witness Radio Show with Michael Levine |publisher=Expertwitnessradio.org |accessdate=December 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724162842/http://www.expertwitnessradio.org/archives/ellsberg.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsberg also testified at the 2004 [[conscientious objector]] hearing of [[Camilo Mejia]] at [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="expertwitnessradio.org"/&gt;

Ellsberg was arrested, in November 2005, for violating a county ordinance for trespassing while protesting against [[George W. Bush]]'s conduct of the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/23/AR2005112302185.html |title=Antiwar Protesters Arrested Near Bush Ranch |work=The Washington Post |date= November 24, 2005|accessdate=December 2, 2010 |first=Rosalind S. |last=Helderman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of [[Campaign for Peace and Democracy]].

Ellsberg criticized the arrest of WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]], who had exposed [[American war crimes]] in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Daniel Ellsberg On Assange Arrest: The Beginning of the End For Press Freedom |url=https://therealnews.com/stories/daniel-ellsberg-on-assange-arrest-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-press-freedom |publisher=[[The Real News]] |date=11 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Activism against US military action against Iran====
In September 2006, Ellsberg wrote in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' that he hoped someone would leak information about a potential U.S. invasion of [[Iran]] before the invasion happened, to stop the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =The Next War | journal =Harper's Magazine
 | date =October 2006 | url =http://harpers.org/archive/2006/10/the-next-war/ | accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsberg called for further leaks following the release of information on the acceleration of U.S.-sponsored anti-government activity in Iran that was leaked to journalist [[Seymour Hersh]]. In November 2007, Ellsberg was interviewed by [[Brad Friedman]] on his blog in regard to former FBI translator turned whistle blower [[Sibel Edmonds]]. "I'd say what she has is far more explosive than the Pentagon Papers", Ellsberg told Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Daniel Ellsberg Says Sibel Edmonds Case 'Far More Explosive Than Pentagon Papers'|url=http://www.bradblog.com/?p=5260|website=The Brad Blog|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on March 30, 2008 in San Francisco's [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] church, Ellsberg observed that [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] doesn't really have the authority to declare [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] "off the table". The oath of office taken by members of congress requires them to "defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic". He also argued that under the [[U.S. Constitution]], treaties, including the [[United Nations Charter]], become the supreme law of the land that neither the states, the president, nor the congress have the power to break. For example, if the Congress votes to authorize an unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation, that authorization wouldn't make the attack legal. A president citing the authorization as just cause could be prosecuted in the [[International Criminal Court]] for [[war crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saryl Weinstein |url=http://warandlaw.homestead.com/files/Ellsnews.htm |title=Congress should probe Bush's Iran attack plan, says Ellsberg, warning of supreme war crime |publisher=Warandlaw.homestead.com |accessdate=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for American whistleblowers===
On December 9, 2010, Ellsberg appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' where he commented that the existence of WikiLeaks helps to build a better government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/368131/december-09-2010/international-manhunt-for-julian-assange---daniel-ellsberg|title=The Colbert Report|website=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2011, Ellsberg, along with 35 other demonstrators, was arrested during a demonstration outside the [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]], in protest of Manning's current detention at [[Marine Corps Brig, Quantico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/843636/arrests-at-wikileaks-marine-base-protest|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714183731/http://news.sky.com/story/843636/arrests-at-wikileaks-marine-base-protest|url-status=dead|title=Arrests At WikiLeaks Marine Base Protest|date=July 14, 2012|archivedate=July 14, 2012|publisher=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2013, Ellsberg published an editorial in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper praising the actions of former [[Booz Allen Hamilton|Booz Allen]] worker [[Edward Snowden]] in revealing top-secret surveillance programs of the [[NSA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel Ellsberg |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/edward-snowden-united-stasi-america |title=Edward Snowden: saving us from the United Stasi of America |work=The Guardian |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |location=London |date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellsberg believes that the United States has fallen into an "abyss" of total tyranny, but said that because of Snowden's revelations, "I see the unexpected possibility of a way up and out of the abyss."

In June 2013, Ellsberg and numerous celebrities appeared in a video showing support for [[Chelsea Manning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html#ixzz2WgfpNmys|title=Celeb video: 'I am Bradley Manning'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFFkcCh-pCc|title=I am Bradley Manning (full HD)|last=I am Bradley Manning|date=June 18, 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2010, Ellsberg was interviewed regarding the parallels between his actions in releasing the Pentagon Papers and those of Private First Class [[Chelsea Manning]], who was arrested by the U.S. military in Iraq after allegedly providing to [[WikiLeaks]] a classified video showing [[July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike|U.S. military helicopter gunships strafing and killing Iraqis]] alleged to be civilians, including two [[Reuters]] journalists. Manning claimed to have provided WikiLeaks with secret videos of additional massacres of alleged civilians in Afghanistan, as well as 260,000 classified [[U.S. State Department|State Department]] cables. Ellsberg said that he fears for Manning and for [[Julian Assange]], as he feared for himself after the initial publication of the Pentagon Papers. WikiLeaks initially said it had not received the cables, but did plan to post the video of an [[Garani airstrike|attack that killed 86 to 145 Afghan civilians]] in the village of Garani. Ellsberg expressed hope that either Assange or President Obama would post the video, and expressed his strong support for Assange and Manning, whom he called "two new heroes of mine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2010/6/17/wikileaks_whistleblowers "With Rumored Manhunt for Wikileaks Founder and Arrest of Alleged Leaker of Video Showing Iraq Killings, Obama Admin Escalates Crackdown on Whistleblowers of Classified Information"] democracynow.org, June 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-15/wikileaks-founder-has-garani-massacre-video-according-to-new-email/ "WikiLeaks Founder to Release Massacre Video"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619124459/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-06-15/wikileaks-founder-has-garani-massacre-video-according-to-new-email/ |date=June 19, 2010 }} http://www.thedailybeast.com, Philip Shenon, June 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Democracy Now!]]'' devoted a substantial portion of its program July 4, 2013, to "How the Pentagon Papers Came to be Published By the Beacon Press Told by Daniel Ellsberg &amp; Others."  Ellsberg said there are hundreds of public officials right now who know that the public is being lied to about Iran. They all took an oath to protect the Constitution of the United States, not the commander-in-chief, not superior officers. If they follow orders, they may become complicit in starting an unnecessary war. If they are faithful to their oath, they could prevent that war. Exposing official lies could however carry a heavy personal cost as they could be imprisoned for unlawful disclosure of classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Goodman |first=Amy |author-link=w:Amy Goodman |title=How the Pentagon Papers Came to be Published By the Beacon Press Told by Daniel Ellsberg &amp; Others |publisher=Democracy Now! |date=July 4, 2013 |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2013/7/4/how_the_pentagon_papers_came_to |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ellsberg became one of the co-founders of the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]].

Ellsberg is a founding member of the [[Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity]].&lt;ref name="AndyWorthington2015-09-15"/&gt;
In September 2015 Ellsberg and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to the President challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee]] on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s use of torture.

In December 2015, Ellsberg publicly supported the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], referencing its utility for [[whistle blowing]] in general for the maintenance of [[democracy]] via the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-tor-supporter-looks-daniel-ellsberg|title=This is What a Tor Supporter Looks Like: Daniel Ellsberg – Tor Blog|website=blog.torproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 2011 Ellsberg camped on the [[UC Berkeley]] [[Sproul Plaza]] as part of an effort to support the [[Occupy Cal]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2011/11/16/4059116/daniel-ellsberg-part-of-uc-berkeley.html Daniel Ellsberg part of UC Berkeley Occupy protest]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Doomsday Machine''===

In December 2017, Ellsberg published ''The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a [[Nuclear War]] Planner''.  He said that his primary job from 1958 until releasing the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' in 1971 was as a nuclear war planner for US Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], [[Lyndon Baines Johnson|Johnson]], and [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]].  He concluded that US nuclear war policy was completely crazy and he could no longer live with himself without doing what he could to expose it, even if it meant he would spend the rest of his life in prison.  However, he also felt that as long as the US was still involved in the Vietnam War, the US electorate would not likely listen to a discussion of nuclear war policy.  He therefore copied two sets of documents, planning to release first the ''Pentagon Papers'' and later documentation of nuclear war plans.  However, the nuclear planning materials were hidden in a [[landfill]] and then lost during an unexpected [[tropical storm]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Canfield, [http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/The-Doomsday-Machine-by-Daniel-Ellsberg-12413956.php 'The Doomsday Machine,' by Daniel Ellsberg] ''San Francisco Chronicle'', retrieved December 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

His overriding concerns are as follows:  
# As long as the world maintains large nuclear arsenals, it is not a matter of if, but when, a nuclear war will occur.  
# The vast majority of the population of an initiator state would likely starve to death during a “nuclear autumn” or “[[nuclear winter]]” if they did not die earlier from retaliation or fallout.  If the nuclear war dropped only roughly 100 nuclear weapons on cities, as in a war between India and Pakistan, the effect would be similar to the "[[Year Without a Summer]]" that followed the [[1815 eruption of Mount Tambora]], except that it would last more like a decade, because soot would not settle out of the stratosphere as quickly as the volcanic debris, and roughly a third of the people worldwide not killed by the nuclear exchange would starve to death, because of the resulting crop failures.  However, if more than roughly 2 percent of the US nuclear arsenal were used, the results would more likely be a [[nuclear winter]], leading to the deaths from starvation of 98 percent of people worldwide not killed by the nuclear exchange.  
# To preserve the ability of a [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear-weapon state]] to retaliate from a “decapitation” attack, every country with nuclear weapons seems to have delegated broadly the authority to respond to an apparent nuclear attack.  

As an example of the third concern, Ellsberg discussed an interview he had in 1958 with a major, who commanded a squadron of 12 F-100 fighter-bombers at [[Kunsan Air Base]], South Korea.  His aircraft were equipped with [[B28 nuclear bomb|Mark 28]] thermonuclear weapons with a yield of 1.1 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]] each, roughly half the explosive power of all the bombs dropped by the US in World War II both in Europe and the Pacific.  The major said his official orders were to wait for orders from his superiors in [[Osan Air Base]], South Korea, or in Japan before ordering his F-100s into the air.  However, the major also said that standard military doctrine required him to protect his forces.  That meant that if he had reason to believe that a war had already begun when his communications with Osan and Japan were broken, he was required to launch his dozen F-100s with their thermonuclear weapons.  They never practiced that launch, because the risk of an accident was too great.  Ellsberg then asked what might happen if he gave such launch orders and the sixth plane succumbed to a thermonuclear accident on the runway.  After some thought, the major agreed that the five planes already in the air would likely conclude that a nuclear war had begun, and they would likely deliver their warheads to their preassigned targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Q|Q63862699}}&lt;!--Doomsday Machine--&gt;, pp. 52ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The “[[nuclear football]]” carried by an aide near the US President at all times is primarily a piece of political theater, a hoax, to keep the public ignorant of the real problems of nuclear command and control, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Q|Q63862699}}&lt;!--Doomsday Machine--&gt;, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, this included a semi-automatic “[[Dead Hand]]” system, whereby a nuclear explosion in Moscow, whether accidental or by a foreign state or terrorists, would induce low-level officers to launch ICBMs toward targets in the US, presumed to be the origin of such attacks.  The first ICBMs launched in this way “would beep a Go signal to any ICBM sites they passed over”, which would launch those other ICBMs without further human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Q|Q63862699}}&lt;!--Doomsday Machine--&gt;, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

He also claimed that every president since Truman, with the possible exception of Ford, threatened the use of nuclear weapons.  Some of these threats were implicit;  many were explicit.  Many governmental officials and authors claimed that those threats made major contributions to achieving important policy objectives. Ellsberg's examples are summarized in the following table:&lt;ref&gt;For more on this, see especially {{cite Q|Q63874626}}&lt;!--Call to Mutiny--&gt;;  {{cite Q|Q63874634}}&lt;!-- Force without War:  U.S. Armed forces as a political instrument --&gt;;  {{cite Q|Q63874641}}&lt;!--Empire and the bomb:  How the U.S. uses nuclear weapons to dominate the world --&gt;;  {{cite Q|Q63874649}}&lt;!-- U.S. Nuclear Threats:  A documentary history --&gt;;  {{cite Q|Q63874665}}&lt;!-- Nuclear Blackmail and Nuclear Balance --&gt;, cited from {{cite Q|Q63862699}}&lt;!--Doomsday Machine--&gt;, especially the second-to-last chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ellsberg has been married twice. His first marriage was to Carol Cummings, a graduate of Radcliffe (now Harvard College) whose father was a Marine Corps brigadier general. It lasted 13 years before ending in divorce (at her request, as he stated in his memoir ''Secrets''). They have two children, [[Robert Ellsberg]] and [[Mary Ellsberg]]. In 1970, he married Patricia Marx, daughter of toy maker [[Louis Marx]]. They lived for some time afterward in [[Mill Valley, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marinij.com/2018/01/25/mill-valleys-counter-culture-on-display/ Mill Valley's counter culture on display], ''[[Marin Independent Journal]]'',  Mary Ann Hogan, Mary Ann Maggiore, Mary Anne Ostrom, January 25, 2018.

==Films==
* ''[[Pentagon Papers (Film)|The Pentagon Papers]]'' (2003) is a [[Historical drama film|historical film]] directed by [[Rod Holcomb]] about the Pentagon Papers and Daniel Ellsberg's involvement in their publication.

[[File:MarkFelt.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Felt]] a.k.a. "Deep Throat"]]

'''Deep Throat''' is the [[pseudonym]] given to the secret informant who provided information in 1972 to [[Bob Woodward]], who shared it with [[Carl Bernstein]]. Woodward and Bernstein were reporters for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and Deep Throat provided key details about the involvement of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration in what came to be known as the [[Watergate scandal]]. In 2005, 31 years after Nixon's resignation and 11 years after Nixon's death, a family attorney stated that former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Associate Director '''[[Mark Felt]]''' was Deep Throat. By then, Felt was suffering from dementia and had previously denied being Deep Throat, but Woodward and Bernstein confirmed the attorney's claim.

==Background==
Deep Throat was first introduced to the public in the February 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' by ''Washington Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]], which was adapted as a [[All the President's Men (film)|film]] two years later. According to the authors, Deep Throat was a key source of information behind a series of articles which introduced the misdeeds of the Nixon administration to the general public. The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as to prison terms for [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[Egil Krogh]], White House Counsel [[Charles Colson]], former United States Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell]], [[John Dean]], and presidential adviser [[John Ehrlichman]].

[[Howard Simons]] was the managing editor of the ''Post'' during Watergate. He dubbed the secret informant "Deep Throat", alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation. Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it. [[J. Anthony Lukas]] speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book ''Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years'' (1976), based on three ''New York Times Sunday Magazine'' articles, but he was widely criticized. According to an article in ''Slate'' on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the "intelligence community" in a 1989 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview with Lukas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Timothy Noah|Noah, Timothy]]. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2003/04/was_fred_fielding_deep_throat.html "Was Fred Fielding Deep Throat?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', April 28, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 31, 2005, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt reportedly said, "I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat." After the ''Vanity Fair'' story broke, Woodward, Bernstein, and [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]], the ''Post''{{'}}s executive editor during Watergate, confirmed Felt's identity as Deep Throat.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Bob. ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7432-8715-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L. Patrick Gray]], former acting Director of the FBI and Felt's boss, disputed Felt's claim in his book ''In Nixon's Web'', co-written with his son Ed Gray. Gray and others have argued that Deep Throat was a compilation of sources characterized as one person in order to improve sales of the book and movie. Woodward and Bernstein, however, defended Felt's claims and detailed their relationship with him in Woodward's book ''The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat''.

==Role in the Watergate scandal==
{{Main|Watergate scandal}}
{{Watergate|Intelligence}}

On June 17, 1972, police arrested five men inside the offices of the [[Democratic National Committee]] in the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. In their possession were $2,300 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|2300|1972|r=-2|fmt=c}} today), burglary tools, a walkie-talkie, a radio scanner capable of listening to police frequencies, cameras, 40 rolls of film, tear gas guns, electronic devices which they apparently intended to plant in the Democratic Committee offices, and notebooks containing the telephone number of White House official [[E. Howard Hunt]]. One of the men was [[James W. McCord Jr.]], a former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] employee and a security man for Nixon's [[Committee to Re-elect the President]] (popularly known as "CREEP").

''Washington Post'' reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward pursued the story for two years. The scandal eventually implicated many members of the Nixon White House, and Nixon became the only US president to resign. Woodward and Bernstein wrote in ''All the President's Men'' that key information in their investigation had come from an anonymous informant whom they dubbed "Deep Throat".

===Methods of communication===
Woodward, in ''All the President's Men'', first mentions Deep Throat on page 71; earlier in the book he reports calling "an old friend and sometimes sources who worked for the federal government and did not like to be called at his office". Later, he describes him as "a source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP as well as at the White House". The book also calls him "an incurable gossip", "in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch", and a man "whose fight had been worn out in too many battles".

Woodward claimed that he would signal to "Deep Throat" that he desired a meeting by moving a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment. When Deep Throat wanted a meeting he would make special marks on page 20 of Woodward's copy of ''[[The New York Times]]''; he would circle the page number and draw clock hands to indicate the hour. They often met "on the bottom level of an underground [[parking garage|garage]] just over the [[Francis Scott Key Bridge (Washington)|Key Bridge]] in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]]", at 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. The garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard and has a historical marker that was erected in 2011. In 2014, the garage was scheduled to be demolished, though the county decided to save the historical marker, and the landowner promised to design a memorial commemorating the Watergate scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=|title='Deep Throat' garage from U.S. Watergate scandal to be razed|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/15/usa-watergate-garage-idUSL2N0OW0J320140615|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=Reuters|date=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2017}}, the garage had not been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goff|first1=Karen|title=Monday Properties asks for more time to redevelop 'Deep Throat' garage|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2017/03/13/monday-properties-asks-for-more-time-to-redevelop.html|accessdate=28 December 2017|work=Washington Business Journal|date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many were skeptical of these [[cloak and dagger]] methods. Adrian Havill investigated these claims for his 1993 [[biography]] of Woodward and Bernstein and found them to be factually impossible. He noted that Woodward's apartment 617 at 1718 P Street, Northwest, in Washington faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Havill said anyone regularly checking the balcony, as "Deep Throat" was said to have done daily, would have been spotted. Havill also said that copies of ''The New York Times'' were not delivered to individual apartments but delivered in an unaddressed stack at the building's reception desk. There would have been no way to know which copy was intended for Woodward. Woodward, however, has stated that in the early 1970s the interior courtyard was an alleyway and had not yet been bricked off and that his balcony was visible from street level to passing pedestrians. It was also visible, Woodward conjectured, to anyone from the FBI in surveillance of nearby embassies. Also revealed was the fact that Woodward's copy of ''The New York Times'' had his apartment number indicated on it. Former neighbor Herman Knippenberg stated that Woodward would sometimes come to his door looking for his marked copy of the ''Times'', claiming, "I like to have it in mint condition and I like to have my own copy."&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10328832"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10328832 |title=New Zealand man's Deep Throat mystery solved |date=June 3, 2005 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, while Woodward stressed these precautions in his book, he also admits to having called "Deep Throat" on the telephone at his home.

===Controversy over motives===
In public statements following the disclosure of his identity, Felt's family called him an "American hero", stating that he leaked information about the Watergate scandal to ''The Washington Post'' for moral and patriotic reasons. Other commentators, however, have speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward.

In his book ''The Secret Man'', Woodward describes Felt as a loyalist and admirer of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. After Hoover's death, Felt became angry and disgusted when [[L. Patrick Gray]], a career naval officer and lawyer from the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Division|Civil Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], with no law enforcement experience, was appointed Director of the FBI over Felt, a 30-year veteran of the FBI. Felt was particularly unhappy with Gray's management style at the FBI, which was markedly different from Hoover's. Felt selected Woodward because he knew Woodward and Bernstein were assigned to investigate the burglary. Instead of seeking out prosecutors at the Justice Department, or the House Judiciary Committee charged with investigating presidential wrongdoing, he methodically leaked information to Woodward to guide their investigation while keeping his own identity and involvement safely concealed.

Some conservatives who worked for Nixon, such as [[Pat Buchanan]] and [[G. Gordon Liddy]], castigated Felt and asserted their belief that Nixon was unfairly hounded from office.&lt;ref name="traitor"&gt;Morgan, Dan (June 1, 2005). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053101420.html "Contemporaries Have Mixed Views"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speculation concerning W. Mark Felt ==
{{Copy edit|section|date=January 2020}}
{{Refimprove|section|date=January 2020}}
=== Speculation within the White House ===
Although confirmation of Deep Throat's identity remained elusive for over 30 years, there were suspicions that Felt was indeed the reporters' mysterious source long before the public acknowledgment in 2005. In ''Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat'', Max Holland reports that Felt leaked to two major sources, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. While the ''Post'' reporters did not reveal their source, ''Time'' correspondent Sandy Smith told ''Time''{{'}}s lawyer, [[Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore]] partner [[Roswell Gilpatric]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; who told [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] of the Department of Justice Criminal Division [[Henry E. Peterson]], who, in turn, revealed it to White House Counsel [[John W. Dean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/26/AR2005062600974.html | work=Washington Post | title=Revenge Was Felt's Motive, Former Acting FBI Chief Says | author=Michael Dobbs | date=June 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who reported it to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Leak: Why Mark Felt Became Deep Throat | author=Max Holland | publisher=Univ Pr of Kansas | date=March 6, 2012 | ISBN= 978-0700618293 | page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nixon did not publicly mention learning Deep Throat's identity. Nixon claimed that if he had done so, Felt would have publicly revealed information damaging to the FBI and to other powerful people and institutions. In the [[Nixon White House tapes#The "smoking_gun" tape|"smoking gun" tape]], Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, stated that Felt "knows everything there is to know in the FBI".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Neikirk |first1=William |last2=Dorning |first2=Mike |title=President Called Felt a 'Traitor' in '73 |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-06-02-0506020166-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Nixon's motives in not outing Felt may not have been entirely altruistic, since Nixon may have been damaged by Felt's potential revelations.

=== Speculation in the press and the public ===
Among other evidence, it had previously been revealed publicly that Deep Throat was definitely a man. Using this and other public hints, real or perceived, some members of the press and the public came to suspect Felt of being Deep Throat. For instance, [[George V. Higgins]] wrote in 1975: "Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a ''Washington Post'' alias borrowed from a dirty movie."&lt;ref&gt;[[George V. Higgins]] (1975), ''The Friends of Richard Nixon'', 1976 reprint, New York: Ballantine, Ch. 14, p. 147, {{ISBN|978-0-345-25226-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Woodward and Bernstein were famously tight-lipped concerning their informant's identity. Carl Bernstein did not even share Deep Throat's identity with his immediate family, which included his wife, writer [[Nora Ephron]]. As he said on NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' on June 2, 2005, "I was never dumb enough to tell her...which was very smart because I would have told the whole world by now."{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Ephron became obsessed with figuring out the secret and eventually correctly concluded that he was Mark Felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050603041501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/nora-ephron/deep-throat-and-me-now-i_1917.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=June 3, 2005 | work=Huffington Post | first=Nora | last=Ephron | title=Deep Throat and Me: Now It Can Be Told and Not for the First Time Either | date=May 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a 19-year-old college freshman, Chase Culeman-Beckman, claimed to have been told by Bernstein's son that Mark Felt was really Deep Throat. According to Culeman-Beckman, Jacob Bernstein had said that he was "100 percent sure that Deep Throat was Mark Felt. He's someone in the FBI."&lt;ref name="Courant"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Daley |first1=David |title=Deep Throat |url=https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1999-07-28-9907280810-story.html |accessdate=24 January 2020 |work=The Hartford Courant |date=28 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob had reportedly said this approximately 11 years prior when he and Chase Culeman-Beckman were classmates. Ephron explained that Jacob overheard her "speculations"; Carl Bernstein himself also immediately stepped forward to reject the claim, as he and Woodward had done for many others.&lt;ref name="Courant"/&gt; James Mann, who had worked at the ''Post'' at the time of Watergate and was close to the investigation, brought a great deal of evidence together in a 1992 article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, James. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199205/mann "Deep Throat: An Institutional Analysis"], ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Mann recalled that prior to the Watergate scandal, Woodward had made references to a high-placed source he had in the FBI. Mann argued that the information that Deep Throat gave Woodward could only have come from FBI files. Felt was also embittered at having been passed over for director of the FBI and believed that the FBI, in general, was hostile to the Nixon administration. In previous unrelated articles, Woodward had made clear he had a highly placed source at the FBI, and there is some evidence he was friends with Felt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Woodward had kept in close touch with Felt over the years, even showing up unexpectedly at his house in 1999, after Felt's [[dementia]] began and at the home of Felt's daughter, Joan, in [[Santa Rosa, California]]. Some suspected at that time that Woodward might be asking Felt if he could reveal him as Deep Throat, though Felt, when asked directly by others, had consistently denied being Deep Throat. In 2002, [[Timothy Noah]] called Felt "the best guess going about the identity of Deep Throat".&lt;ref&gt;Noah, Timothy. [http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2002/05/why_did_bob_woodward_lunch_with_mark_felt_in_1999.html "Why Did Bob Woodward Lunch With Mark Felt in 1999?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', May 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Assistant Attorney General [[John Stanley Pottinger]] had convened a [[grand jury]] to investigate a series of potentially illegal break-ins that Felt had authorized against various dissident groups. Felt was testifying before the jury when a juror asked him, out of the blue, "Are you Deep Throat?"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Pottinger reports that Felt "went white with fear".{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Pottinger explained to Felt that he was under oath and would have to answer truthfully, but since Pottinger felt the question was outside the purview of the investigation, he offered to withdraw it if Felt wished.

In his book ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', [[Ronald Kessler]] wrote that Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the Santa Rosa home where Felt was staying with his daughter Joan and took Felt to lunch.&lt;ref name="Kessler"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2016|ISBN=9781250111265|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan, who was caring for her father, told Kessler that her father had greeted Woodward like an old friend. Their meeting appeared to be more of a celebration than an interview. "Woodward just showed up at the door and said he was in the area,"{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} Joan Felt was quoted as saying in Kessler's book, which was published in 2002. "He came in a white limousine, which parked at a schoolyard about ten blocks away. He walked to the house. He asked if it was okay to have a martini with my father at lunch, and I said it would be fine."&lt;ref name="Kessler"/&gt; Kessler said in his book that the measures Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent "credence" to the notion that Felt was Deep Throat. "There are plenty of people claiming they knew Deep Throat was actually former FBI man Mark Felt&amp;nbsp;... On May 3, 2002, the page reported that Ronald Kessler, author of ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI'', says that all the evidence points to former top FBI official W. Mark Felt."{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}}

In February 2005, Nixon's former White House Counsel, news columnist John Dean, reported that Woodward had recently informed Bradlee that "Deep Throat" was ailing and that Bradlee had written Deep Throat's obituary. Both Woodward and the then-current editor of ''The Washington Post'', [[Leonard Downie]], denied these claims. Felt was something of a suspect, especially after the mysterious meeting that occurred between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999. But others had received more attention over the years, such as [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Henry Kissinger]], then-Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]], General [[Alexander Haig]], and before it was revealed that "Deep Throat" was definitely not female, [[Diane Sawyer]].

=== Felt's confirmation of his identity ===
On May 31, 2005, ''Vanity Fair'' reported that Felt, then aged 91, claimed to be the man once known as "Deep Throat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John D.|last= O'Connor|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2005/07/deepthroat200507?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all|title=I'm the Guy They Called Deep Throat|date=May 31, 2005|accessdate =November 28, 2008|publisher= VanityFair.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, Woodward, Bernstein, and Bradlee released a statement through ''The Washington Post'' confirming that the story was true. On June 2, 2005, ''The Washington Post'' ran a lengthy front-page column by Woodward in which he detailed his friendship with Felt in the years before Watergate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Bob|last= Woodward|authorlink=Bob Woodward|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060102124_pf.html|title=How Mark Felt Became 'Deep Throat'|date=June 2, 2005 |accessdate =November 28, 2008|work= [[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward wrote that he first met Felt by chance in 1970 when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant in his mid-20s who was dispatched to deliver a package to the White House's West Wing. Felt arrived soon after, for a separate appointment and sat next to Woodward in the waiting room. Woodward struck up a conversation, eventually learning of Felt's position in the upper echelon of the FBI. Woodward, who was about to get out of the Navy at the time and was unsure about his future direction in life, became determined to use Felt as a [[mentor]] and career advisor, and so he got Felt's phone number and kept in touch with him.

After deciding to try a career as a reporter, Woodward eventually joined ''The Washington Post'' in August 1971. Felt, who Woodward writes had long had a dim view of the Nixon administration, began passing pieces of information to Woodward, although he insisted that Woodward keep the FBI and Justice Department out of anything he wrote based on the information. The first time Woodward used information from Felt in a ''Washington Post'' story was in mid-May 1972, a month before the Watergate burglary, when Woodward was reporting on [[Arthur Bremer]], who had attempted to assassinate presidential candidate [[George C. Wallace]]; Nixon had put Felt in charge of investigating the would-be assassin. A month later, just days after the Watergate break-in, Woodward would call Felt at his office, marking the first time Woodward spoke with Felt about Watergate.

Commenting on Felt's motivations for serving as his Deep Throat source, Woodward wrote, "Felt believed he was protecting the bureau by finding a way, clandestine as it was, to push some of the information from the FBI interviews and files out to the public, to help build public and political pressure to make Nixon and his people answerable. He had nothing but contempt for the Nixon White House and their efforts to manipulate the Bureau for political reasons."{{uncited quote|date=January 2020}} In 1980, Felt himself was convicted of ordering illegal break-ins at the homes of [[Weatherman (organization)|Weathermen]] suspects and their families. Richard Nixon testified on his behalf. President [[Ronald Reagan]] pardoned Felt and the conviction was subsequently expunged from the record.

==Composite character theory==
Prior to Felt's revelation and Woodward's confirmation, part of the reason historians and other scholars had so much difficulty in identifying the real Deep Throat is that no single person seemed to truly fit the character described in ''All the President's Men''. This had caused some scholars and commentators to come to the conclusion that Deep Throat could not possibly be a single person, and must be a composite of several sources. Woodward and Bernstein consistently denied the theory.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=David |date=June 1, 2005 |title=Throat Clearing; Watergate conspiracy theories that still won't die. |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2005/06/throat_clearing.single.html |newspaper=Slate |location= |publisher= |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a literary business perspective, this theory was further supported by [[David Obst]], the agent who originally marketed the draft for ''All the President's Men'', who stated that the initial typescript of the book contained absolutely no reference to Deep Throat.&lt;ref name=" Greenberg"/&gt; Obst believed that Deep Throat was invented by Woodward and Bernstein for dramatic purposes.&lt;ref name=" Greenberg"/&gt; It also led to speculation that the authors played at condensing history in the same way [[Hollywood]] scriptwriters do.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;

Ed Gray, the son of [[L. Patrick Gray III]], stated in ''In Nixon's Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate'' that his examination of Woodward's interview notes pertaining to Deep Throat at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] provided "convincing evidence that 'Deep Throat' was indeed a fabrication".&lt;ref name=" Gray &amp; Gray"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gray III |first1=L. Patrick |authorlink=L. Patrick Gray |last2=Gray |first2=Ed |date=2008 |chapter=The Watergate Books: Fact and Fiction |chapterurl=http://www.lpatrickgrayiii.com/images/watergate/INWChapter30BlueNotice.pdf |title=In Nixon's Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSXcfeGWooQC&amp;printsec=frontcover |location=New York |publisher=Times Books |pages=291–300 |isbn=9780805089189 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gray, the file contained notes regarding four interviews that were attributed to either Felt, "X", or "my friend", and a fifth interview dated March 24, 1973, that was unattributed.&lt;ref name="Gray &amp; Gray"/&gt; He said he discovered that he had already seen the paper in 2006 after Woodward released interview files with people who were not Deep Throat.&lt;ref name="Gray &amp; Gray"/&gt; Gray wrote that he contacted Stephen Mielke, the archivist who oversees the Woodward-Bernstein collection at the University of Texas, who said that a carbon copy of the paper contained a note in Woodward's handwriting attributing the interview to Donald Santarelli, an official with the Department of Justice during the Watergate era.&lt;ref name=" Gray &amp; Gray"/&gt; Gray wrote that he contacted Santarelli who confirmed that the March 24 meeting was with him.&lt;ref name=" Gray &amp; Gray"/&gt; Other interview notes attributed to "X" were interpreted by Gray as containing content that could not have been known by Felt.&lt;ref name=" Gray &amp; Gray"/&gt;

Regarding Gray's allegations, Woodward wrote that the March 24 notes were obviously not from an interview with Felt because Felt is referred to by name twice in quotes from the source and that he never stated or wrote that he met with Deep Throat on that date.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bobwoodward.com/full-biography#Deep_Throat_Revealed |title=Full Biography |last1=Woodward |first1=Bob |date= |website=bobwoodward.com |publisher=Bob Woodward |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Woodward, Mielke said the page was likely misfiled under Felt due to a lack of source.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

==Other suspected candidates==

===Fred Fielding===
Another leading candidate was White House Associate Counsel [[Fred F. Fielding]]. In April 2003 Fielding was presented as a potential candidate as a result of a detailed review of source material by [[William Gaines (professor)|William Gaines]] and his journalism students, as part of a class at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] journalism school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194614/http://archive.deepthroatuncovered.com/ Deep Throat: Uncovered] (archived), Department of Journalism, University of Illinois&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Who_Was_Deep_Throat.html Who Was Deep Throat?], ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'', December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding was the assistant to John Dean and as such had access to the files relating to the affair. Gaines felt that statements by Woodward ruled out Deep Throat's being in the FBI and that Deep Throat often had information before the FBI did. H. R. Haldeman himself suspected Fielding as being Deep Throat.

Dean had been one of the most dedicated hunters of Deep Throat. Both he and [[Leonard Garment]] dismissed Fielding as a possibility, reporting that he had been cleared by Woodward in 1980 when Fielding was applying for an important position in the Reagan administration. However, this assertion, which comes from Fielding, has not been corroborated.

One reason that many experts believed that Deep Throat was Fielding and not Felt was due to Woodward's apparent denial in an interview that "Deep Throat" worked in the intelligence community:

: LUKAS: Do you resent the implication by some critics that your sources on Watergate—among them the fabled Deep Throat—may have been people in the intelligence community?

: WOODWARD: I resent it because it's untrue.&lt;ref&gt;Noah, Timothy. [http://www.slate.com/id/2119870/ "Deep Throat, Antihero: His unmasking makes everybody look a little less noble"], ''Slate'', May 31, 2005. Quote from ''Playboy'' interview, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other credible candidates===
Any candidate who died before the Felt admission ceased to fit Woodward's criteria at that time since Woodward had stated that he was free to reveal his identity when "Deep Throat" died.
* [[John Ehrlichman]]: Nixon advisor. Died in 1999.
* [[Ron Ziegler]]: press secretary. Died in 2003.
* [[William Colby|William E. Colby]]: head of the CIA. Died in 1996.
* Charles W. Bates: FBI executive whom Mann mentioned but considered less likely than Felt.
* [[William C. Sullivan]]: former head of the FBI intelligence operations, fired by J. Edgar Hoover in 1971. Died in 1977.
* [[L. Patrick Gray]]: acting FBI director who lived only four blocks away from Woodward, accused by a [[CBS]] documentary. Died in 2005.
* Robert Kunkel: FBI Washington Bureau Chief whom Mann considered less likely than Felt, as he moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] partway through the investigation.
* [[Cord Meyer]]: CIA agent suggested in [[Mark Riebling]]'s ''[[Wedge: The Secret War between the FBI and CIA]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Wedge: From Pearl Harbor to 9/11-How the Secret War between the FBI and CIA Has Endangered National Security'', (2002) Touchstone {{ISBN|0-7432-4599-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Woodward stated that "Deep Throat" was not part of the intelligence community. Died in 2001.
* [[Raymond Price (speechwriter)|Raymond Price]]: Nixon speechwriter.
* Stephen Bull: administrative assistant.
* [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] technicians: [[Richard Cohen (columnist)|Richard Cohen]] argued it was whoever in the Secret Service maintained Nixon's secret taping devices.
* [[Richard Ober]], the chief of the CIA's domestic spying program called [[Operation CHAOS]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Davis, 'Katharine the Great: Katharine Graham and the Washington Post' (1987) National Press, {{ISBN|0-915765-43-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Less credible candidates===
* [[William Rehnquist]]: Late [[Chief Justice of the United States]], had a position in the Department of Justice early in the Nixon administration, working for [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]]. More than five months before the Watergate break-in, he was appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and it would have been almost impossible for him to have had access to much of the information attributed to "Deep Throat". In February 2005, Dean reported that "Deep Throat" was ailing, and Rehnquist was known to be suffering from cancer, which caused his death later that year. The report caused a resurgence of speculation that Rehnquist was "Deep Throat". However, Woodward later stated that the notion that "Deep Throat" was ailing had been a misunderstanding.
* [[Henry Kissinger]]: Nixon's [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], was out of the country on some of the dates Woodward reported to have met with "Deep Throat".
* [[George H. W. Bush]]: Was nominated in February 2005 by [[Adrian Havill]]–author of a 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein, ''Deep Truth'' ({{ISBN|1-55972-172-3}})-following the unveiling of Woodward's notes at the [[the University of Texas System|University of Texas]]. Havill had argued in his biography that "Deep Throat" was a composite figure, but stated in a letter to ''[[Poynter Online]]'' that based on more recent events and research, he now believed "Deep Throat" was George H. W. Bush.
* General [[Alexander Haig]]: Authors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin speculated in their 1991 book ''Silent Coup: The Removal of a President'' that Haig may have been "Deep Throat". Died in 2010.
* [[Diane Sawyer]]: Was hired by White House press secretary Ron Ziegler to serve in the Richard Nixon Administration. On his deathbed, Nixon supporter [[Baruch Korff]] wrongly claimed that Sawyer was Deep Throat.
* [[Ben Stein]]: A Nixon speechwriter and the son of Nixon economic advisor [[Herbert Stein]]; later an [[actor]], political commentator, and [[game show host]].
* [[Gerald R. Ford]]: Suggestion that Ford may have been Deep Throat as he was next in line for the presidency.
* [[Pat Buchanan]]: Served as special assistant to the President, was nominated as a potential candidate by Dean in his June 2002 book ''Unmasking Deep Throat''. Buchanan repeatedly denied the claim, stating in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article on the 30th anniversary of the Watergate break-in that "The last time I cooperated with ''The Washington Post''...was in 1952, when I was a paperboy delivering the damn thing in Northwest Washington." Buchanan was very interested in the mystery, however, and had a number of theories. He was most sympathetic to the idea of a composite Deep Throat.
* [[Richard Nixon]] himself: There was some suggestion that Nixon had used back-channels to communicate with Woodward in a bizarre attempt to showcase his persecution by the media which backfired horrifically. This theory was largely discredited.
* [[J. Fred Buzhardt]]: White House counsel to President Nixon.
* [[G. Gordon Liddy]]: Member of the [[White House Plumbers]]. Largely dismissed.

==Fictional portrayals==
===Audio dramas===
* 3Sol used the name Deep Throat to lure Tyler Steele to his attempted assassination in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]'s ''[[Torchwood (audio drama series)#Aliens Among Us (2017–18)|Torchwood: Aliens Among Us 1]]''.

===Films===
* [[Hal Holbrook]] portrayed Deep Throat in the film adaptation of ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976), in which he uttered the catchphrase, "[[Follow the money]]".
* In the comedy film ''[[Dick (film)|Dick]]'' (1999), Deep Throat is revealed as being two teenage Washingtonian girls, portrayed by [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], who worked as Nixon's dog walkers.
* In the Nickelodeon animated film ''[[Hey Arnold!: The Movie]]'' (2002), Helga Pataki takes on a similar role under the guise of Deep Voice. She is a shadowy character who aids Arnold and Gerald in trying to save the neighborhood from the evil developer Alphonse Perrier du von Scheck through a series of anonymous phone calls and cryptic advice. At the end of the film, her identity is revealed, and she finally confesses her love to Arnold and successfully saves the neighborhood.
* In the [[Spy film|spy]] [[thriller film]] ''[[Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House]]'' (2017), [[Liam Neeson]] portrays Mark Felt.

===Games===
*In the video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]'' (1998), the cyborg ninja informant [[Gray Fox (Metal Gear)|Gray Fox]] goes by the name Deepthroat until revealing his identity to protagonist [[Solid Snake]].
**Similarly, in the sequel, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' (2001), the name is briefly assumed by [[List of Metal Gear characters#Olga Gurlukovich|Olga Gurlukovich]], until the protagonist [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]] realizes her connection to Gray Fox of the previous game, at which point she uses the less explicit name "Mr. X", instead.

===Literature===
* In Terry Pratchett's   [[Discworld]] novel ''The Truth'' (2000), in a reference to or parody of Deep Throat, the talking dog Gaspode takes on the role of Deep Bone, acting as an informant to the novel's protagonist William de Worde regarding the attempted framing of Patrician Vetinari.

===Television===
* In the ''[[Fairly OddParents]]'' episode "[[Channel Chasers]]", Tootie uses the "Deep Toot" undercover persona to help out Mr. and Mrs. Turner against Vicky.
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Deep Throats]]", [[Kermit the Frog]] plays a similar role to provide evidence of [[Mayor West|Mayor Adam West]]'s corruption to [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]].
*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]", [[Waylon Smithers]] played a similar role to Deep Throat's when covertly helping the Simpson children find a way to depose the newly elected mayor of Springfield, Sideshow Bob (he even paraphrased one of Deep Throat's statements).
*''[[The X-Files]]'' featured an informant who was identified by the name "[[Deep Throat (The X-Files)|Deep Throat]]".  This "Deep Throat" leaked secret government information to the series character [[Agent Mulder]] in a manner similar to the meetings described by Woodward. The character never identified himself as "Deep Throat"—the name was used by other characters when referring to him.  It was never specifically mentioned whether he was initially intended to be the same Deep Throat from Watergate; eventually, the character was revealed to be a government official named Ronald Pakula.
* In season 1 of ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', Perry White has a government contact called Sore Throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0635154/|title=Honeymoon in Metropolis|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[Frasier]]'', season 4 episode 11 "[[Three Days of the Condo]]", [[Frasier Crane|Frasier]] meets a secretive informant in an underground parking garage who supplies him with information.
*In the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Drippy Pony", there is a sketch where a shadowed man approaches a man in a parking garage. The man asks him if he is Deep Throat, but the shadowed man replies that he is Rim Job, and tells the man to go up to Level P2.
*In the [[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]] episode "Buster the Myth Maker", Brain acts as an informant under the pseudonym Deep Float.

{{Nixon series}}

The '''impeachment process against Richard Nixon''' began in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on October 30, 1973, following the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]" episode of the [[Watergate scandal]]. The [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] set up an impeachment inquiry staff and began investigations into possible [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachable offenses]] by [[Richard Nixon]], the [[List of Presidents of the United States|37th]] [[president of the United States]]. The process was formally initiated on February 6, 1974, when the House granted the Judiciary Committee authority to investigate whether sufficient grounds existed to impeach President Nixon of [[high crimes and misdemeanors#United States|high crimes and misdemeanors]] under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 4: Impeachment|Article II, Section 4]], of the [[United States Constitution]]. This investigation was undertaken one year after the [[United States Senate]] established the [[United States Senate Watergate Committee|Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities]] to investigate the 1972 break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters at the [[Watergate hotel|Watergate office complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Nixon administration]]'s attempted cover-up of its involvement; during those hearings the scope of the scandal became apparent and the existence of the [[Nixon White House tapes]] was revealed. 

Following an April 1974 [[subpoena]] from the Judiciary Committee, edited transcripts of 42 taped White House conversations relevant to the Watergate cover-up were made public by the president. But the committee pressed for the audio tapes themselves, and subsequently issued subpoenas for additional tapes, all of which Nixon refused. That same month he also refused to comply with a subpoena from [[Special prosecutor#Watergate|special prosecutor]] [[Leon Jaworski]] for 64 Watergate-related tapes. Ultimately, on July 24, 1974, the [[United States Supreme Court]] issued a [[United States v. Nixon|unanimous decision against the president]], ordering him to comply.

On May 9, 1974, formal hearings in the impeachment inquiry of President Nixon began, culminating July 27–30, 1974, when the Democratic-led Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment. The articles charged the president with: 1) [[obstruction of justice]] in attempting to impede the investigation of the Watergate break-in, protect those responsible, and conceal the existence of other illegal activities; 2) [[abuse of power]] by using the office of the presidency on multiple occasions, dating back to the first year of his administration (1969), to unlawfully use federal agencies, such as the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], as well as establishing a covert [[White House Plumbers|White House special investigative unit]], to violate the constitutional rights of citizens and interfere with lawful investigations; and 3) [[contempt of Congress]] by refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas.&lt;ref name=R44260&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|Garvey|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These articles were reported to the House of Representatives for final action, with 7 of the committee's 17 Republicans joining all 21 of its Democrats in voting in favor of one or more of the articles. Two other articles were debated in committee but were rejected. Based on the strength of the evidence presented and the [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] support for the articles in committee, [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House leaders of both political parties]] concluded that Nixon's impeachment by the full House was a certainty if it reached the House floor for a final vote, and that his conviction in a Senate trial was a distinct possibility.

On August 5, 1974, Nixon released a transcript of one of the additional conversations to the public, known as [[Nixon White House tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|the "smoking gun" tape]], which made clear his complicity in the Watergate cover-up. Reaction to this disclosure was swift—he lost the support of his most loyal defenders in Congress with respect to the obstruction of justice article of the charges. Republican congressional leaders met with and told Nixon that both his impeachment and his conviction were inevitable. Thereupon, Nixon gave up the struggle to remain in office, resigning the presidency on August 9, 1974, before the full House could vote on the articles of impeachment. Although arrangements for a final House vote along with a Senate trial were being made at the time, further formal action was rendered unnecessary by his resignation, so the House brought the impeachment process against him to an official close two weeks later.

Nixon was the first U.S. president in over a century, since [[Andrew Johnson]] [[impeachment of Andrew Johnson|in 1868]], to be the subject of formal impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.{{efn|Andrew Johnson was the only U.S. president prior to Richard Nixon to be the subject of a formal House of Representatives impeachment inquiry; however, five previous presidents—[[John Tyler]], Andrew Johnson, [[Grover Cleveland]], [[Herbert Hoover]] and [[Harry S.

== Background ==
{{main|Watergate scandal}}

The [[Watergate scandal]] began with the June 17, 1972, break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters at the [[Watergate Office Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Nixon administration]]'s attempted cover-up of its involvement.&lt;ref name=Burglary2004CNN&gt;{{cite news| title=A burglary turns into a constitutional crisis| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/06/11/watergate/index.html| accessdate=May 13, 2014| work=CNN| date=June 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1973, the same month in which [[Second inauguration of Richard Nixon|President Nixon began his second term]], the burglars each went on trial separately before [[United States federal judge|U.S. District Judge]] [[John Sirica]]; all pleaded or were found guilty.&lt;ref name=vanderVoort2Coverup&gt;{{Cite web| last=van der Voort| first=Tom| title=Watergate: The Cover-Up| url=https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/watergate/watergate-cover| work=The Presidency Educational Resources| publisher=The Miller Center, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; That February, the [[United States Senate]] voted to create a special investigative committee to look into the scandal.

On May 25, 1973, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Elliot Richardson]] appointed [[Archibald Cox]] as [[special prosecutor]] for the federal investigation into possible Nixon administration ties to the Watergate burglary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Archibald Cox Appointed Prosecutor for Watergate| last=Ripley| first=Anthony| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/19/archives/archibald-cox-appointed-prosecutor-for-watergate-richardson.html| date=May 19, 1973| page=77| work=The New York Times| accessdate=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Small|1999}}, pp. 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his investigation, in July of that year, Cox asked Judge Sirica to issue a [[subpoena]] for several "relevant and important" [[Nixon White House tapes|White House tape recordings]] and documents; Senator Ervin did so as well.&lt;ref name=vanderVoort2Coverup/&gt; The president, who denied prior knowledge of the Watergate burglary or participating in its cover-up, which he claimed to have been unaware of until earlier in 1973, refused to comply with the subpoenas, citing [[executive privilege]] and national security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Small|1999}}, pp. 285–287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nixonresigns"&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;| title=Nixon Resigns| series=The Watergate Story| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part3.html| work=The Washington Post| accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an address to the nation on Watergate the following month, Nixon justified his refusal:

Nixon's adamant refusal to comply with the subpoenas for the tapes sparked a [[constitutional crisis]] between the White House and Congress and the special prosecutor.&lt;ref name=Burglary2004CNN/&gt; On August 9, the Senate committee filed suit in [[United States district court|federal district court]] to force President Nixon to make the subpoenaed tapes available.&lt;ref name=Senate081273NYT&gt;{{cite news| title=The Senate Sues| date=August 12, 1973| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/12/archives/the-issue-is-joinedon-all-3-sides-the-senate-sues-still-nixon.html| page=174| newspaper=The New York Times| location=New York, New York| accessdate=October 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to avoid making a ruling, the Court asked the parties to negotiate an out of court solution; their effort to find an acceptable compromise failed however, largely due to Nixon's intransigence.&lt;ref name=ruling52NYT&gt;{{cite news| title=Judges Rule 5‐2| last=Oelsner| first=Lesley| date=October 13, 1973| page=1| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/13/archives/judges-rule-52-historic-decision-finds-president-not-above-laws.html| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=December 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Nixon soon began contemplating ways to accommodate Cox, the Senate Watergate committee, and Sirica after two polls showed that public opinion was solidly against him: 61 percent of those responding to a [[Gallup Poll]] said the president should release the subpoenaed tapes to the court; 54 percent of those responding to a [[Harris Poll]] said Congress would be justified in beginning impeachment proceedings against the president if he refused to obey a court order directing him to turn over the tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ambrose|1991}}, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Stennis Compromise}}&lt;!-- "Stennis Compromise" redirects here. --&gt;

In a 5–2 ruling on October 12, a [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. court of appeals]] upheld Sirica's subpoena.&lt;ref name=ruling52NYT/&gt; Weakened by the decision, the president, together with [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] and [[White House Press Secretary|Press Secretary]] [[Ron Ziegler]], moved forward with a proposed compromise: the White House would prepare transcripts of the tapes, Senator [[John C. Stennis]], a Democrat, and chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]], would be asked to listen to the tapes himself and make a comparison between the transcripts and the tapes. His authenticated version would be submitted to the court. The White House also wanted to empower Stennis to paraphrase language that in its original form would, in his judgment, be embarrassing to the President, and wanted an assurance from Cox that no other tapes would be subpoenaed by his office. The administration's explanation was that Stennis would be sensitive to matters of national security contained within. However, as Stennis was hard-of-hearing and on heavy doses of medication since being mugged and shot earlier in the year, it is believed that the president did not want the tapes entered into the public record verbatim, because they contained recordings of him and others using coarse language and racial slurs, and making possibly incriminating statements. When the plan was presented to him, Cox categorically rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodward|Bernstein|2005}}, pp. 62–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kutler|1990}}, pp. 402–405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ambrose|1991}}, pp. 241–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, on October 20, after being directed by the White House to make no further attempts to obtain tapes, notes or memoranda of presidential conversations, Cox held a news conference to state that he would continue pressing in court for the tapes, even if it meant asking that Nixon be held in contempt if the White House refused to turn them over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Woodward and Bernstein: Nixon fired the man investigating him.

== Early calls for impeachment ==

During the opening months of the [[93rd United States Congress|93rd Congress]], multiple [[Simple resolution|resolutions]] calling for a presidential impeachment inquiry were introduced in the House and referred to its [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]]. The committee began an examination of the charges under its general investigative authority. In February 1973, the House approved a resolution providing additional investigative authority that did not specifically mention impeachment.&lt;ref name=R45769&gt;{{Harvnb|Rybicki|Greene|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first resolution to directly call for President Nixon's impeachment was introduced on July 31, 1973, by [[Robert Drinan]].{{efn|Prior to the Watergate break-in, in May 1972, during the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]], three [[Vietnam War]]-related impeachment resolutions were introduced in the House against President Nixon: a general resolution without specific charges, introduced by [[William Fitts Ryan|William Ryan]], plus two identical four-count resolutions from [[John Conyers]]. These were referred to the House Judiciary Committee; no further action on the resolutions is recorded.&lt;ref name=CRS98-763/&gt;&lt;ref name=MH08011973NYT/&gt;}} His resolution, which did not contain specific charges, was made in response to Nixon's clandestine authorization of the [[Operation Menu|bombing of Cambodia]], as well as his actions relative to the growing Watergate scandal.&lt;ref name=MH08011973NYT&gt;{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Marjorie |date=August 1, 1973 |title=House Gets Impeach‐Nixon Resolution |newspaper=The New York Times |page=23 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/01/archives/house-gets-impeachnixon-resolution-littleused-provision-following.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was effectively ignored by [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|leaders of both parties]].&lt;ref name=Farrell2019Politico&gt;{{Cite web| title=What History Can Teach Democrats About Impeachment| last=Farrell| first=John A.| authorlink=John A.

{{quote|Morally, Drinan had a good case. But politically, he damn near blew it. For if Drinan's resolution had come up for a vote at the time he filed it, it would have been overwhelmingly defeated—by something like 400 to 20. After that, with most of the members already on record as having voted once against impeachment, it would have been extremely difficult to get them to change their minds later on.&lt;ref name=drinan&gt;{{Cite news| last=Feeney| first=Mark| title=Rev.

By September 1973, there was a sense that Nixon had regained some political strength, the American public had become burned out by the Watergate hearings, and Congress was not willing to undertake impeachment absent some major revelation from the White House tapes or some egregious new presidential action against the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Apple Jr.|1973}}, pp. 61–65.&lt;/ref&gt; There was, nonetheless, a public appetite for information about impeachment, piqued by the legal maneuvering over the tapes.&lt;ref name=Senate081273NYT/&gt; Accordingly, the Judiciary Committee prepared a 718-page book on the topic. Published in October 1973, it traces the origin of the impeachment power, cites all the instances in which that power had previously been used by Congress and gives a detailed description of Andrew Johnson's 1868 Senate impeachment trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Book Explaining Impeachment Published by House Committee| date=October 21, 1973| page=52| newspaper=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/21/archives/book-explaining-impeachment-published-by-house-committee.html| accessdate=October 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparation for impeachment inquiry ==

=== Initiating the inquiry ===
[[File:Impeach Nixon retouched.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|Demonstrators in Washington, D.C., demanding that Congress impeach President Nixon, following the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"]]

The October 20 "Saturday Night Massacre" rapidly became a public relations disaster for Nixon. Shortly after the White House announced the firing and the resignations, [[NBC News]] anchor [[John Chancellor]] interrupted the network's [[prime time]] programming with a dire message: "The country tonight is in the midst of what may be the most serious constitutional crisis in its history."&lt;ref name=WS2017lessons&gt;{{Cite web| title=Lessons From Saturday Night Massacre for Trump and Democrats| last=Shapiro| first=Walter| date=December 29, 2017| url=https://www.rollcall.com/news/opinion/lessons-from-saturday-night-massacre-for-trump-and-democrats| website=rollcall.com| accessdate=October 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, ''[[The New York Times]]'' declared: "The nation is in the hands of a president overcome with dictatorial misconceptions of his constitutional authority."&lt;ref name=WS2017lessons/&gt; The White House and congressional offices were deluged with a record shattering 450,000 telegrams, most demanding Nixon's impeachment; hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the White House, loudly demanding the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gormley|1997}}, pp. 361–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's firing of Archibald Cox triggered an uproar in Congress as well.

Further, Nixon's actions were widely criticized by Republican congressional leaders, who demanded "full and complete disclosure" to investigators of all subpoenaed Watergate materials as well as the appointment of a new special prosecutor.&lt;ref name=Niven2017PH&gt;{{harvnb|Nevin|2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, Nixon agreed to turn the subpoenaed tapes over to Judge Sirica.{{efn|On November 21, 1973, special White House counsel for Watergate matters [[J.

Speaker Albert, who at the time was first in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]], following the resignation of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew]] on October 10, cautioned the committee against taking impulsive or {{nowrap|ill-considered}} action on impeachment; he also called on Congress to take swift action on the [[1973 United States vice presidential confirmation|nomination]] of [[Gerald Ford]] to fill the vice presidential vacancy.{{efn|President Nixon nominated House Minority Leader Gerald Ford to succeed Vice President Spiro Agnew on October 12, 1973, under terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]], Section 2.

On November 4, 1973, Senator [[Edward Brooke]] became the first congressional Republican to publicly urge President Nixon to resign.

As the Judiciary Committee prepared to begin a formal impeachment inquiry, the president tried once more to contain the situation.

On February 6, 1974, the House Judiciary Committee was authorized to launch a formal impeachment inquiry against the president. The House approved the resolution 410–4.&lt;ref name=USNWRtoppled/&gt;&lt;ref name=HDoc109153&gt;{{harvnb|United States House of Representatives 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The vote, which was not a test of impeachment sentiment, validated the investigation begun by the committee the previous October. During the debate over this measure, Chairman Rodino said: "Whatever the result, whatever we learn or conclude, let us now proceed with such care and decency and thoroughness and honor that the vast majority of the American people, and their children after them, will say: This was the right course. There was no other way." House Minority Leader [[John Jacob Rhodes]] said Rodino's vow to conduct the inquiry fairly and within a short amount of time was "good with me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/07/archives/house-4104gives-subpoena-power-in-nixon-inquiry-judiciary-panel-is.html |title=House, 410–4, Gives Subpoena Power in Nixon Inquiry |first=James M. |last=Naughton |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 7, 1974 |pages=1, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first task Doar assigned to the attorneys on the inquiry staff was to examine the constitutional and legal questions related to impeachment and to ascertain what constituted "[[high crimes and misdemeanors]]"{{snd}}one of the grounds stated in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 4: Impeachment|Article II, Section 4]] of the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] for impeachment of a federal official.&lt;ref name=Woods2000HLJ/&gt; This was a necessary first step as it had been over a century since the only prior American presidential impeachment, that of Andrew Johnson in 1868, and Judiciary Committee members desired guidance on the history, standards, and process of impeachment.&lt;ref name="Politico09162019"&gt;{{cite news| first=Darren| last=Samuelson| title=Hillary Clinton's Zombie Impeachment Memo That Could Help Fell Trump| website=politico.com| publisher=Politico| date=September 16, 2019| url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/16/hillary-clinton-impeachment-memo-trump-228107| accessdate=September 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it had been nearly 40 years since the committee had even initiated an impeachment inquiry, not since 1936 against U.S. District Judge [[Halsted Ritter]].&lt;ref name=HDoc109153/&gt;&lt;ref name="bernstein-95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007}}, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Impeachment staff Senior Associate Special Counsel [[Joseph A. Woods Jr.]] supervised the staff's constitutional and legal research.&lt;ref name=Woods2000HLJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=BK03101974NYT/&gt;

As a result of an in-depth study of how the constitutional language about impeachment came to be adopted during the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|1787 Constitutional Convention]] and of the long history of [[impeachment in the United Kingdom|British impeachment cases]], the staff produced a guide for the Judiciary Committee, a 64-page report, entitled "Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment."&lt;ref name=Woods2000HLJ/&gt; A key determination made in the report was that there did not need to be a criminal act on the part of the president to justify impeachment.&lt;ref name=HDoc109153/&gt;&lt;ref name="bernstein-101"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2007}}, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; It stated: "The Framers did not write a fixed standard. Instead they adopted from English history a standard sufficiently general and flexible to meet future circumstances and events, the nature and character of which they could not foresee."&lt;ref name="Politico09162019"/&gt; It further concluded that impeachable offenses could fall into three categories: "exceeding the powers of the office in derogation of those of another branch of government," "behaving in a manner grossly incompatible with the proper functions and purpose of the office," and "employing the power of the office for an improper purpose or personal gain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Jipping| first1=Thomas| last2=von Spakovsky| first2=Hans| title=The Impeachment Process: The Constitution and Historical Practice| date=July 29, 2019| url=https://www.heritage.org/node/14822339/print-display| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=November 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document became a focal point of the Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry.{{efn|The 1974 ''Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment'' has subsequently been used as a guidebook during two House presidential impeachment inquiries: against [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton in 1998]] and against [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|Donald Trump in 2019]].&lt;ref name="Politico09162019"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Politico09162019"/&gt; The White House was quick to reject the report's central conclusion, asserting that only criminal offenses of "a very serious nature" are grounds for impeaching the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kovach| first=Bill| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/01/archives/white-house-moves-to-narrow-grounds-for-an-impeachment-nixon-aides.html| title=White House Moves To Narrow Grounds For an Impeachment| page=1| newspaper=The New York Times| date=March 1, 1974| accessdate=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the committee's anti-impeachment Republicans ordered a separate report prepared, one more in line with the White House view, Albert Jenner, who disagreed with that position, put off completing the request.

Overseeing the factual investigations were senior associate special counsels [[Richard Cates]] and [[Bernard Nussbaum]]. Under their guidance, inquiry staff members, working in teams, endeavored to collect and assemble factual information and evidence relevant to the various allegations made against Nixon.&lt;ref name=1990Kutler480/&gt; Major investigations were conducted into: his complicity in covering up the Watergate burglary; his creation of the covert [[White House Plumbers|White House special investigative unit]] and that unit's subsequent illegal activities; and his personal finances since entering office, to determine whether he had committed tax fraud. Among the dozens of other matters considered by the investigators were allegations that [[ITT Inc.|International Telephone and Telegraph]] and [[Dairy Farmers of America|American Milk Producers]] [[Pay to play|benefited politically]] from contributions to [[Richard Nixon 1968 presidential campaign|Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign]], and charges that the Nixon administrated had interfered with the investigation by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] of [[Robert Vesco]], who had donated $200,000 in 1972 to the [[Committee to Re-Elect the President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Doar Says Inquiry Is Concentrating on 7 Areas of Allegations Against Nixon| last=Rosenbaum| first=David E.| date=April 26, 1974| page=20| newspaper=New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/26/archives/doar-says-inquiry-is-concentrating-on-7-areas-of-allegations.html| accessdate=January 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was put together on more than 500,000 five-by-seven-inch note cards that were cross-indexed against each other.&lt;ref name="bernstein-101"/&gt; Mastering this filing system became a requirement of anyone working on the inquiry.&lt;ref name=wandb113114/&gt;

A constant worry among impeachment inquiry staff leaders was that developments from their research, discussions and preliminary conclusions would leak to the press. To minimize leaks, Doar established strict rules of conduct that included this directive: "The staff of the impeachment inquiry shall not discuss with anyone outside the staff either the substance or procedure of their work or that of the committee."&lt;ref name=BK03101974NYT/&gt; Security guards patrolled the halls of the [[O'Neill House Office Building|House Annex-1 building]] in which a myriad of lawyers, investigators, clerks, and stenographers worked in rooms with closed blinds.&lt;ref name=wandb113114/&gt; Doar in particular had the attorneys on the inquiry working on isolated areas so that only a few of the senior counsels knew the big picture.&lt;ref name="bernstein-95"/&gt; In a March 9, 1974, story [[Bill Kovach]] wrote in ''The New York Times'' that staff members worked "under security conditions that suggest a classified defense project."&lt;ref name=BK03101974NYT/&gt; Opinions differ, however, as to how successful these efforts were at preventing leaks.&lt;ref name="bernstein-101"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR05092005&gt;{{cite episode| title=Watergate Figure Peter Rodino Dies| access-date=September 29, 2019 |series=Morning Edition| last=Block| first=Melissa| authorlink=Melissa Block| network=NPR| date=May 9, 2005| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4645365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2005, Doar said of Rodino:

On March 1, 1974, the [[United States district court|federal district court]] [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] that had been impaneled in July 1972 to investigate the Watergate break-in handed up indictments against seven Nixon advisers and aides, including [[H.

The documentation consisted of a 55-page index that enumerated testimony, tapes, and other items of evidence, but omitted legal analysis and offered no conclusions regarding whether there were impeachable actions in Nixon's behaviors.

Buffeted by allegations that, since taking office, Nixon had greatly underpaid what he owed the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] in taxes, the president had agreed in December 1973 to publicly release his returns covering the years 1969 through 1972. He also asked [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation]] to examine his personal finances. The committee's report, issued April 3, 1974, found several problems with Nixon's returns, and said he owed $476,431 including interest for unpaid taxes over four years.&lt;ref name=HDoc109153/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=How Nixon's tax trouble could influence quest for Trump's returns| last=Faler| first=Brian| date=December 23, 2018| work=Politico| url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/12/23/nixon-trump-tax-returns-1050587| accessdate=October 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doar was quick to state that an examination of whether fraud was involved in the preparation of the tax returns and the claiming of certain large deductions was clearly within the scope of the impeachment inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/09/archives/nixon-tax-study-in-house-to-touch-on-possible-fraud-doar-asserts.html| last=Kovack| first=Bill| date=April 9, 1974| title=Nixon Tax Study In House To Touch On Possible Fraud| page=1| newspaper=the New York Times| accessdate=November 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, Rodino and Doar understood that their ability to build a case against Nixon was dependent upon the president's willingness to comply with their requests for material. Though the documentation received from the grand jury contained actionable information, they both concluded more information was needed. Their case was still circumstantial, consisting mostly of broad practices of abuse on the part of the administration, and lacked direct evidence proving that the president had knowledge of or was a participant in the Watergate conspiracy; for this, they needed the tapes, and to receive them they would need Nixon's cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodward|Bernstein|2005}}, pp. 117–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 1974, by a 33–3 vote, the Judiciary Committee subpoenaed 42 White House tapes of pertinent conversations.

Consequently, Nixon agreed that transcripts of the tapes requested by the Judiciary Committee, with certain passages edited or removed, would be released, but that Jaworski's request for tapes and other documents would be denied. Jaworski could be stonewalled for months, the president reasoned, whereas the committee could not. Nixon announced this decision to a national television audience on April 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ambrose|1991}}, pp. 317–326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodward|Bernstein|2005}}, pp. 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon inspecting the transcripts, Nixon, shocked by several profanity-laced discussions among his inner circle, ordered that every use of profanity be replaced by "[[Expletive deleted|EXPLETIVE DELETED]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=That time Nixon released doctored transcripts during Watergate| last=Brockell| first=Gillian| date=September 25, 2019| newspaper=The Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/09/25/trump-ukraine-that-time-nixon-released-doctored-transcripts-during-watergate/| accessdate=October 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first phase of the hearings, May 9{{snd}}June 21, the committee's impeachment inquiry staff reported their accumulated evidence on the various charges against the president.&lt;ref name=Davis05192019Hill&gt;{{cite web| title=Today's Congress can learn from the Nixon impeachment inquiry| last=Davis| first=Evan A.| date=May 19, 2019| website=thehill.com| url=https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/443585-todays-congress-can-learn-from-the-nixon-impeachment-inquiry| accessdate=October 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, detailed evidence was presented showing how President Nixon had [[Obstruction of justice|obstructed justice]] and [[Abuse of power|abused presidential power]] during the investigation of the Watergate break-in.&lt;ref name=DER06051974NYT&gt;{{cite news| last=Rosenbaum| first=David E.| title=An Explanation: Nixon, I.T.T. and Milk Case| date=June 5, 1974| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/05/archives/a-n-explanation-nixon-itt-and-milk-case-itt-subsequent-developments.html| page=29| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=December 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff then turned the committee's attention to evidence that the money given to the Nixon presidential campaign by International Telephone and Telegraph and American Milk Producers contravened [[campaign finance]] laws.&lt;ref name=DER06051974NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Conway| first=Michael| date=December 17, 2018| title=Trump, like Nixon, won't be impeached over campaign finance violations.

In considering whether any one of the various allegations made against the president constituted an impeachable offense, the committee focused foremost on Article II, Section{{nbsp}}4 of the Constitution, which specifies the grounds on which a president can be impeached: "treason, bribery, and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors." During the course of the hearings there was fervent debate about the nature of an impeachable offense under Article II, whether only criminally indictable offenses qualified as "high crimes and misdemeanors" or whether the definition was broader.&lt;ref name=justiaNIP&gt;{{cite web| title=The Nixon Impeachment Proceedings| url=https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/54-the-nixon-impeachment-proceedings.html| website=law.justia.com| publisher=Justia| location=Mountain View, California| accessdate=October 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Presser| first=Stephen B.| title=Essays on Article II: Standards for Impeachment| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/100/standards-for-impeachment| work=Heritage Guide to the Constitution| publisher=The Heritage Foundation| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=October 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans on the committee maintained that a president could "be impeached only for committing a serious felony," while Democrats asserted that a president could "be impeached for severe violations of public trust that are not inherently criminal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The 38 who weigh Nixon's fate| last=Naughton| first=James M.| date=April 28, 1974| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/28/archives/article-3-no-title-theirs-is-a-burden-few-sought-but-curiously-in-a.html| page=289| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=November 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the committee began examining the accumulated evidence it concluded that Nixon's edited transcripts did not comply with the terms of the earlier April subpoena.&lt;ref name=Politico08052018/&gt;&lt;ref name=RN2PR&gt;{{Cite web| title=Nixon to Rodino: Description| url=https://history.house.gov/HouseRecord/Detail/15032449719| publisher=Office of the Historian, U.S. House of Representatives| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=November 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two subpoenas were then issued on May 15 for the tape recordings of 11 conversations believed to concern the Watergate case, and diaries of Nixon's White House meetings during an eight‐month period in 1972 and 1973.&lt;ref name=RNrejects&gt;{{Cite news| title=Nixon Rejects Subpenas, Tells Rodino He Will Get No More Watergate Data| last=Herbers| first=John| date=May 23, 1974| page=1| newspaper=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/23/archives/nixon-rejects-subpoenas-tells-rodino-he-will-get-no-more-wa-terga.html| accessdate=November 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon, filled with indignation by "the continued succession of demands for additional presidential conversations," refused to comply,&lt;ref name=RN2PR/&gt; stating in a letter to Chairman Rodino that "he had already submitted all material pertinent to his role in the Watergate case." Nixon further declared that he would likewise reject any future subpoenas.&lt;ref name=RNrejects/&gt; This refusal later became the basis for the committee's third article of impeachment.&lt;ref name=RN2PR/&gt;

On May 30 the committee responded in a stern letter, again informing the president that it was not within his power to decide what evidence should be presented. Issued by a vote of 28–10, the letter also warned the president that his continued refusal might lead committee members to draw "adverse inferences" concerning the substance of the materials (that is, whether they contained incriminating evidence), and that the noncompliance itself might constitute grounds for impeachment. Eight Republicans joined the committee Democrats in approving the letter. The committee then approved a third subpoena for Watergate-related material, asking the White House for tapes of 45 conversations and for material from certain White House files related to the break-in and cover-up; only Republican Edward Hutchinson voted against issuing the subpoena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=House Panel Warns Nixon It May Find Tape Refusal Ground For Impeachment| url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Watergate/Watergate%20Items%2014541%20to%2014842/Watergate%2014842.pdf| last=Naughton| first=James N.| date=May 31, 1974| page=1| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=November 11, 2019| via=The Weisberg Collection, Hood College, Frederick, Maryland.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the first phase of the hearings, the committee, on June 24, issued four more subpoenas for additional White House tapes and materials related to a variety of issues of concern.

Next, on June 27, the president's counsel, James St. Clair, opened President Nixon's impeachment defense before the House Judiciary Committee. In Nixon's defense St. Clair argued that the president could be impeached only on solid proof of "great offenses committed against the government," not simply "maladministration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=The Boston Globe| title=James St. Clair, Represented Nixon During Watergate Case|  newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel| date=March 12, 2001| url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2001-03-12-0103110340-story.html| accessdate=November 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase of the hearings, Republican committee members and St. Clair were permitted to name witnesses they wanted to hear from and devise subpoenas they wanted issued, but any such requests had to be approved by the full committee, meaning the majority had an ability to block said requests if they wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Fondos| first=Nicholas| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-process-scif.html?searchResultPosition=3| title=Why Is Democrats' Impeachment Inquiry Out of Public View?| website=nytimes.com| date=October 24, 2019| publisher=The New York Times| accessdate=October 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long and contentious debate, the committee agreed to hear five such witnesses in closed session: [[John Dean]] (former White House counsel), [[Frederick LaRue]] (a former White House and Nixon re-election campaign aide), [[Herbert W.

All through the hearings, President Nixon attempted to preserve his support in the House by wooing senior figures there, including some conservative Democrats, by inviting them to White House functions or evening cruises on the presidential yacht {{USS|Sequoia|presidential yacht|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Germond|1999}}, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, statements from White House officials grew increasingly more scathing, the overall impeachment inquiry was derided as a "partisan witch hunt" and the committee's proceedings derided as "a kangaroo court."&lt;ref name=Fateful08051974Time&gt;{{cite magazine| title=The Fateful Vote to Impeach| author=&lt;!-- TIME staff; no by-line. --&gt;| url=https://time.com/3079519/the-fateful-vote-to-impeach/| date=August 5, 1974 | volume=104| issue=6| magazine=Time| publisher=Time Inc.| location=New York, New York| accessdate=September 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Releasing evidence to public ===
[[File:Members and staff of House Judiciary Committee 1974.png|thumb|upright=1.40|Members and staff of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974]]

On July 9, the Judiciary Committee released its own version of eight of the White House tapes of which Nixon had previously issued his own transcript. The committee transcripts benefited from superior playback equipment, which restored some of the potentially damaging statements that Nixon staffers had removed or heard differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|Bernstein|2005}}, pp. 235–236.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed three days later by the committee's release of its accumulated evidence, which ran to 4,133 pages in all—3,891 pages assembled by the impeachment inquiry staff, as well as a 242-page rebuttal by James St. Clair, but contained neither commentary nor conclusions from the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=House Committee Issues The Voluminous Evidence From Watergate Inquiry| date=July 12, 1974| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/12/archives/house-committee-issues-the-voluminous-evidence-from-watergate.html| page=1| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=November 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward St. Clair acknowledged for the first time publicly that a committee vote in favor of impeachment was likely, but White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler said the president remained confident that the full House would not impeach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|Bernstein|2005}}, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten days after arguing the case of ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], July 18, 1974, St. Clair presented his final argument against impeaching the president to the Judiciary Committee. A vote to impeach could be justified only by "clear and convincing" evidence, he told the committee, "because anything less than that, in my view, is going to result in recrimination, bitterness and divisiveness among the people."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|Bernstein|2005}}, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; He then attempted to refute the charges related to Nixon's involvement in the Watergate cover-up, and also outlined the president's position on the various other issues brought before the committee by the inquiry staff. In closing St. Clair said, "in light of the complete absence of any conclusive evidence demonstrating Presidential wrongdoings sufficient to justify the grave action of impeachment, the committee must conclude that a recommendation of impeachment is not justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;| title=St. Clair Asserts Panel Lacks Data For Citing Nixon| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/21/archives/st-clair-asserts-panel-lacks-data-for-citing-nixon-charges-rebutted.html| date=July 21, 1974| page=1| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=November 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, Doar, who had heretofore maintained a neutral stance on impeachment, painted a picture for the committee of a president who by his actions had attempted to subvert the Constitution. Speaking about the rule of law and presidential obligations and about the evidence, he made the case for articles of impeachment against on charges of: obstruction justice, abuse of power for political purposes, defying Judiciary Committee subpoenas, and tax evasion.&lt;ref name=Fragile08051974NYT/&gt; "Reasonable men acting reasonably," he said, "would find the president guilty" of misusing the power of his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;| title=Doar Summary Stresses Nixon Role in Watergate| date=July 22, 1974| page=23| newspaper=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/22/archives/doar-summary-stresses-nixon-role-in-watergate-haldemans-role-cited.html| accessdate=November 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Albert Jenner, the impeachment inquiry committee's chief minority counsel, said he "agreed with every word" Doar had spoken.

A Harris Poll was released in mid-July which showed that 53 percent of Americans supported Nixon's impeachment by the House. That same poll showed that 47 percent thought he should be convicted in a Senate trial and removed from office, and 34 percent thought he should be acquitted (19 percent were undecided).&lt;ref name=Fateful08051974Time/&gt; A Gallup Poll, released July 25, revealed that Nixon's overall job approval rating had slipped to a new low point of 24 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Nixon At Low Point In The Gallup Poll| date=July 26, 1974| newspaper=The New York Times| page=15| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/26/archives/nixon-at-low-point-in-the-gallup-poll.html| accessdate=November 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; down considerably from its pre-Watergate hearings peak of 67 percent at the end of January 1973 (immediately after announcing the [[Paris Peace Accords]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Newport| first=Frank| date=February 11, 1998| title=History Shows Presidential Job Approval Ratings Can Plummet Rapidly| url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/4258/History-Shows-Presidential-Job-Approval-Ratings-Can-Plummet-Rapidly.aspx| publisher=Gallup| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=December 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''United States v. Nixon'' ruling ===

In a much-anticipated landmark ruling on July 24, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered President Nixon to release all White House tapes, not just selected transcripts, pertinent to the Watergate investigation. The unanimous ruling in ''United States v.

A short while after the decision was made public, Nixon issued a statement saying that, while "disappointed in the result, I respect and accept the court's decision, and I have instructed Mr. St. Clair to take whatever measures are necessary to comply with that decision in all respects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=President Bows| last=Shabecoff| first=Philip| date=July 25, 1974| url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Watergate/Watergate%20Items%2016648%20to%2016835/Watergate%2016828.pdf| page=1| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=November 17, 2019| via=The Weisberg Collection, Hood College, Frederick, Maryland.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president was at the [[La Casa Pacifica|Western White House]] in California at the time, where he remained through July 28.&lt;ref name=PS07291974NYT&gt;{{Cite news| title=Aides Term Nixon Self‐controlled| last=Shabecoff| first=Philip| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/29/archives/aides-term-nixon-selfcontrolled-they-say-president-stoically-tends.html| date=July 29, 1974| page=1| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=December 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debating accumulated evidence ===
[[File:Press coverage of House Judiciary Committee hearings on impeachment of Richard Nixon.png|thumb|left|upright=1.05|The Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings received intense press attention. Portions were broadcast live on television.]]

Ready to consider a resolution to impeach President Nixon, the Judiciary Committee resumed public hearings on July 24; the process of debating, amending and rewriting the proposal (known as "[[Markup (legislation)|markup]]) continued through July 30. As agreed to by the committee, two days of general debate were held (July 24–25), and then each article of impeachment in the proposed resolution was considered separately.&lt;ref name=R45769/&gt; The final four-day debate on the articles had an estimated television audience of 35–40{{nbsp}}million people, according to [[Nielsen ratings]], with the average U.S. household watching 1.9 days of the debates, for an average of 3 hours 49 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kutler|1990}}, p.531.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairman Rodino set the tone for the proceedings in his opening remarks, saying: "We have deliberated. We have been patient. We have been fair. Now the American people, the House of Representatives and the Constitution and the whole history of our republic demand that we make up our minds."&lt;ref name=NPR05092005/&gt; Then, the second ranking Democrat on the committee, [[Harold Donohue]], set the framework, introducing the proposed resolution of impeachment, which included two draft articles.&lt;ref name=Charges07241974NYT&gt;{{cite news| title=2 Charges Listed| last=Naughton| first=James M.| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/25/archives/2-charges-listed.html| date=July 25, 1974| page=69| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=December 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first accused Nixon of having obstructed justice by participating in the Watergate cover-up. The second listed a number of alleged abuses of presidential authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kutler|1990}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-h532i_VnqUC&amp;pg=PA518 p. 518].&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, one by one, committee members spoke. Democrat [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Jack Brooks]], who had been enthusiastically working toward Nixon's impeachment and conviction, expressed his hope that Republicans could not, any more than Democrats, "tolerate the flouting of our laws by a president who is constitutionally charged with seeing to faithful execution of the laws."&lt;ref name=Charges07241974NYT/&gt; He also urged the committee not to waver in its pursuit of the president's impeachment. "This is not a pleasant duty, but it is our constitutional duty," he said. "Its performance may mean ignoring personal and political relationships of long standing. But we as well as the president are on trial for how faithfully we fulfill our constitutional responsibility."&lt;ref name=executioner05112019&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Man Richard Nixon Called His 'Executioner'| last1=McNulty| first1=Timothy| last2=McNulty| first2=Brendan| date=May 11, 2019| url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/amp/story/2019/05/11/richard-nixon-jack-brooks-impeachment-articles-226870| work=Politico| accessdate=November 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in July, Brooks had drafted and distributed to all members of the committee a strongly-worded set of impeachment articles. Though strident and partisan, they provided the impetus for other Democrats to begin framing articles of their own. Further, the Brooks articles heavily influenced the set of articles presented to the committee on July 24.&lt;ref name=Fateful08051974Time/&gt; Because of the part he played in the president's downfall, Nixon later called Brooks his "executioner."&lt;ref name=executioner05112019/&gt;

[[Walter Flowers]], a [[Southern Democrats|Southern Democrat]] from Alabama, a state which supported Nixon in 1972, had been leaning against impeachment, but after a long struggle, he indicated on July 25 that he would vote for impeachment. The congressman said: "I felt that if we didn't impeach, we'd just ingrain and stamp in our highest office a standard of conduct that's just unacceptable."&lt;ref name=Fateful08051974Time/&gt; [[Charles Rangel]] had a somber yet positive take that day on the proceedings. Viewing them as confirmation of the Constitution's soundness, he declared: "Some say this is a sad day in America's history. I think it could perhaps be one of our brightest days. It could be really a test of the strength of our Constitution, because what I think it means to most Americans is that when this or any other president violates his sacred oath of office, the people are not left helpless."&lt;ref name=time40/&gt;
[[File:Barbara Jordan on House Judiciary Committee during Watergate impeachment hearings.png|thumb|left|upright=1.05|Representative Barbara Jordan (left) became nationally known for her eloquence during the Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings.]]

On July 25, 1974, Democrat [[Barbara Jordan]] delivered a robust speech extolling the U.S. Constitution and its [[checks and balances]]. With a booming voice she declared: "I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution."&lt;ref name=HistoryJordan&gt;{{cite web| author=&lt;!-- History.com Editors; no by-line. --&gt;| title=Barbara C.

The first visible crack in the ranks of Republican committee members opened July 23 when [[Lawrence Hogan]] announced that he would vote for impeachment, charging that Nixon had "lied repeatedly" to Congress and to the American people.&lt;ref name=time40/&gt; He had frequently defended the president before the committee during the hearings,&lt;ref name=Hogan09292019WAPO&gt;{{cite news| title='A very bad blow': The GOP lawmaker who turned on Nixon paid a price for it| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/09/29/a-very-bad-blow-gop-lawmaker-who-turned-nixon-paid-price-it/| last=Rosenwald| first=Michael| date=September 29, 2019| newspaper=The Washington Post| accessdate=September 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; "but after reading the transcripts," he said, describing how he decided to support impeachment, "it was sobering: the number of untruths, the deception, and the immoral attitudes. At that point, I began tilting against the president, and my conviction grew steadily."&lt;ref name=Fateful08051974Time/&gt; Reflecting nearly 20 years later, Nixon described Hogan's defection as "a very bad blow."&lt;ref name=Hogan09292019WAPO/&gt;
 
Two days later, Republican [[Hamilton Fish IV|Hamilton Fish]] indicated his willingness to support certain articles of impeachment. "At the very least," Fish explained, the president "is bound not to violate the law, not to order others to violate the law, and not to participate in the concealment of evidence respecting violations of the law of which he is made aware."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Hamilton Fish (1926–1996) Congressional Papers, 1968–1994 SC21149a: Biographical Note| website=nysed.gov| url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc21149a.htm| publisher=New York State Library, University of the State of New York—New York State Education Department| location=Albany, New York| accessdate=November 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Cohen]] also announced his decision to vote in favor of impeachment, saying: "I have been faced with the terrible responsibility of assessing the conduct of a president that I voted for, believed to be the best man to lead this country. But a president who in the process by act or acquiescence allowed the rule of law and the Constitution to slip under the boots of indifference and arrogance and abuse."&lt;ref name=time40/&gt; Similarly, [[M. Caldwell Butler]] also announced his decision to vote in favor of impeachment, saying: "For years we Republicans have campaigned against corruption and misconduct.{{nbsp}}... but Watergate is our shame."&lt;ref name=time40/&gt;

As the public hearings resumed, a coalition composed of [[Moderate Republican]]s Fish, Butler, Cohen, and [[Tom Railsback]], plus Southern Democrats Walter Flowers, [[James Mann (South Carolina politician)|James Mann]] and [[Ray Thornton]], began crafting articles of impeachment on [[abuse of power]] and [[obstruction of justice]]. Their work ensured that the wording of the committee's final set of articles would have solid bipartisan support.&lt;ref name=Fateful08051974Time/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charges07241974NYT/&gt;

Other Republicans on the committee, however, looked at the evidence but concluded that it did not meet their standards for impeachment. [[Wiley Mayne]], for one, contended that the case against Nixon was circumstantial, nothing but "a series of inferences piled upon other inferences."&lt;ref name=Fateful08051974Time/&gt; Even so, he was critical of the administration's ''moral tone'' when he spoke on July 25, saying he certainly deplored "the sorry example which was set by the chief executive{{nbsp}}... in his personal as well as his official conduct."&lt;ref name=debaters07281974NYT&gt;{{cite news| title=Debaters Ask: What Warrants Impeachment?

Nixon's Republican defenders had, from the start of the impeachment hearings, construed the evidence as narrowly as possible, demanded ironclad proof and offered innocuous interpretations of information damaging to the president.&lt;ref name=sandman&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/27/nyregion/ex-rep-charles-sandman-nixon-supporter-dies.html| title=Ex-Rep.

Sandman Jr.]] asserted on July 24 that those advocating impeachment had failed to provide decisive evidence that the president had committed an impeachable offense. During his opening speech he said, "If somebody, for the first time in seven months, gives me something that is direct, I will vote to impeach."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Sandman Adheres to Role of a 'Strict Constructionist'| last=Tolchin| first=Martin| date=August 4, 1974| page=54| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/04/archives/sandman-adheres-to-role-of-a-strict-constructionist-stalwart.html| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=January 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, [[Charles E. Wiggins]], perhaps President Nixon's strongest defender during the House proceedings, eloquently sought to reinforce the message that there was no specific evidence directly linking Nixon to any criminal act,&lt;ref name="nyt-wiggins-aug6"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/06/archives/wiggins-for-impeachment-others-in-gop-join-him-wiggins-says-hell.html| title=Wiggins for Impeachment; Others in G.O.P. Join Him| first=David E.| last=Rosenbaum| newspaper=The New York Times| date=August 6, 1974| page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring, "Simple theories, of course, are inadequate." He then added, "That is not evidence. A supposition, however persuasive, is not evidence. A bare possibility that something might have happened is not evidence."&lt;ref name=JMN07261974NYT&gt;{{cite news| title=A Committee Impeachment Vote By Sizable Bipartisan Majority Is Indicated As Debate Goes On| last=Naughton| first=James M.| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/26/archives/a-committee-impeachment-vote-by-sizable-bipartisan-majority-is.html| page=69| newspaper=The New York Times| date=July 26, 1974| accessdate=November 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, committee Democrats and pro-impeachment Republicans pointed to specific presidential acts and conversations they considered solid evidence. In doing so, they frequently turned to transcripts of taped presidential conversations to read back Nixon's own words.&lt;ref name=WAPO07281974&gt;{{cite news| title=Judiciary Committee Approves Article to Impeach President Nixon, 27 to 11|  last1=Lyons| first1=Richard| last2=Chapman| first2=William| date=July 28, 1974| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/072874-1.htm| newspaper=The Washington Post| page=1| accessdate=September 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was Democrat [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], who recited quote after quote to frame her argument.&lt;ref name=JMN07261974NYT/&gt;

At the close of the marathon two-day general debate, Rodino said publicly for the first time that he would recommend the adoption of the articles of impeachment. By then it was clear that a sizable bipartisan majority of Judiciary Committee members were prepared to support the resolution formally proposing the impeachment of President Nixon—all 21 Democrats plus six Republicans according to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=JMN07261974NYT/&gt; As the committee pressed ahead the next day to consider its proposed articles of impeachment, Deputy White House Press Secretary [[Gerald Lee Warren]] noted that Nixon was "virtually resigned to the likelihood" that the committee would recommend impeachment with a bipartisan majority. But nonetheless, he added: "Our belief is that the House will not vote out a bill of impeachment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Nixon Is Confident, Press Aide Asserts| date=July 27, 1974| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/27/archives/nixon-is-confident-press-aide-assertss.html| page=62| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=December 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debating articles of impeachment ===

==== Obstruction of justice ====

At the outset of the committee's proceedings on July 26, [[Paul Sarbanes]] offered a [[Substitute amendment|substitute]] for Harold Donohue's first article of impeachment. Formulated through negotiations between liberal Democrats, led Jack Brooks, and the Southern Democrat – Moderate Republican coalition group, it passed, following two days of impassioned debate, by a 27–11 margin; with six Republicans voting in favor along with all 21 Democrats.&lt;ref name=Fragile08051974NYT&gt;{{Cite news| title=How a Fragile Centrist Bloc Emerged As House Panel Weighed Impeachment| last=Naughton| first=James M.| others=Based on reporting by the author, R.

Republicans continued to challenge those who would impeach to come up with more details in purposeful conversations to be linked together as part of a concerted plan of action,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Bernstein 2005, pp. 292–293.&lt;/ref&gt; their objective being to maneuver those favoring impeachment into divisive arguments over what particulars to include.&lt;ref name=debaters07281974NYT/&gt; Ultimately, the tactic proved ineffective and was abandoned.

==== Abuse of presidential power ====

On July 29, [[William L. Hungate|William Hungate]] offered a substitute for Donohue's second article of impeachment. Formulated through the same process as the first article substitute, it passed, following a spirited debate, by a 28–10 margin; with seven Republicans voting ''yes'' along with all 21 Democrats.&lt;ref name="nyt-art2"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/30/archives/new-accusation-nixon-is-charged-with-failure-to-uphold-nations-laws.html| title=New Accusation| first=James M.| last=Naughton| newspaper=The New York Times| date=July 30, 1974| page=1| accessdate=December 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that the president had "repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens" by "impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries."&lt;ref name=JS11152019CBS/&gt; Moreover, it asserted that the president had violated his [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|his constitutional oath]] and failed in his [[Take Care Clause|duty to take care]] that [[Law of the United States|the nation's laws]] are faithfully executed by:
# Attempting to use the Internal Revenue Service to initiate tax audits or obtain confidential tax data for political purposes;
# Using a "national security" cover for a series of secret wiretaps against government officials, newsmen and the president's brother, [[F. Donald Nixon|Donald Nixon]];
# Establishing the White House special investigations unit, later dubbed the "[[White House Plumbers|plumbers]]," for "covert and unlawful activities" that included the 1971 burglary of the office of a psychiatrist in search of information to defame [[Daniel Ellsberg]] for his part in publication of the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'';
# "Failing to act" on the knowledge that close subordinates had sought to impede justice in the Watergate case and related matters;
# "Knowingly" misusing the power vested in his office to interfere with activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Justice and the Watergate special prosecutor.&lt;ref name="nyt-art2"/&gt;

In support of the president's impeachment, [[George E. Danielson]] made a forceful argument for Article II, calling it "the most important article this committee may pass out." He went on to say that: "The offenses charged are uniquely presidential offenses. No one else can commit them.{{nbsp}}... Only the president can violate the oath of the office of president.{{nbsp}}... Only the president can harm the presidency."&lt;ref name=Exerpts7291974NYT&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;| title=Excerpts From Transcript of the Proceedings on Impeachment| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/30/archives/excerpts-from-transcript-of-the-proceedings-on-impeachment-morning.html| date=July 30, 1974| newspaper=The New York Times| page=18| accessdate=January 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also supporting Article II (after opposing Article I) was the committee's second ranking Republican, [[Robert McClory]], whose view it was that the article "really gets at the crux" of the committee's responsibility for holding the president accountable for his actions while in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kutler|1990}}, p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt; Its inclusion in the impeachment resolution would, he said, "aid future Presidents to know this Congress and this House Judiciary Committee will hold them to an oath of office and an obligation to see that the laws are faithfully executed."&lt;ref name="nyt-art2"/&gt;

Though there was no doubt that the article would be approved, Nixon's stalwart Republican defenders continued to press the president's case.&lt;ref name=outnumbered7301974NYT&gt;{{Cite news| title=Wiggins, Sandman, Dennis: For Nixon, Outnumbered| last=Apple Jr.| first=R.

He warned that "Adoption of such an article would embed in our constitutional history for the first time{{nbsp}}... the principle that a president may be impeached because of the view of Congress that he has abused his powers although he may have acted in violation of no law."&lt;ref name=Exerpts7291974NYT/&gt; He also attempt to narrow the scope and gut key allegations, but every amendment he proposed was easily defeated by the substantial bipartisan majority favoring the article.&lt;ref name=outnumbered7301974NYT/&gt;

==== Contempt of Congress ====

On July 30, the final day of its impeachment debate, Article III, charging Nixon with contempt of Congress for his defiance of eight Judiciary Committee subpoenas, issued during April, May and June 1974, was introduced by Robert McClory, and was approved by a narrow 21–17 margin.&lt;ref name="nyt-art3"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/31/archives/house-panel-21-to-17-charges-nixon-with-defying-subpoenas-ends-its.html| title=House Panel, 21 to 17, Charges Nixon with Defying Subpoenas| first=James M.| last=Naughton| newspaper=The New York Times| date=July 31, 1974| page=1| accessdate=December 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president's refusal to comply with federal court and congressional subpoenas had been included among the various charges of abuses of authority in the initial version of Article II, but was absent from substitute.&lt;ref name=JMN07261974NYT/&gt; Proponents argued that Nixon's consistent "stonewalling" constituted an impeachable offence as it threatened to diminish the House's constitutional impeachment power.

==== Cambodia bombing / war powers ====

Next, [[John Conyers]] introduced an article charging that Nixon had intentionally concealed from Congress "the facts" and had submitted to Congress "false and misleading statements concerning the existence, scope and nature of American [[Tactical bombing|bombing]] operations in [[Cambodia]]" in disregard of Congress's [[War Powers Clause|constitutional power to declare war]].&lt;ref name=Conyers1974BlackScholar&gt;{{harvnb|Conyers|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=123124Labovitz1978&gt;{{harvnb|Labovitz|1978}}, [https://archive.org/details/presidentialimpe00labo/page/123 pp. 123–124].&lt;/ref&gt; Conyers, an outspoken Nixon critic (and number 13 on [[Nixon's Enemies List]]), argued that the president's desire to cover-up the facts of the bombing campaign was another example of the issue underlying "all of the acts [of presidential wrongdoing] that have been debated thus far."&lt;ref name=NYT2failed&gt;{{cite news| title=2 Articles Fail To Win In Panel| last=Rosenbaum| first=David E.| date=July 31, 1974| page=1| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/31/archives/2-articles-fail-to-win-in-panel-taxes-and-bombing-issues-defeated.html| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=October 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article failed to gain widespread support, however, and was defeated 12–26. Nine Democrats, including Rodino, along with all 17 Republicans voted against it.&lt;ref name="nyt-art3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=politico073014&gt;{{cite web| title=Committee rejects tax impeachment for Nixon, July 30, 1974| last=Glass| first=Andrew| date=July 30, 2014| website=politico.com| url=https://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/committee-rejects-tax-impeachment-for-nixon-july-30-1974-109517| accessdate=October 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no one challenged the veracity of the allegations contained in the article, it failed, Conyers later observed, because "condemning the Cambodian bombing would also have required us to indict previous administrations and to admit that the Congress has failed to fully meet its own constitutional obligations."&lt;ref name=Conyers1974BlackScholar/&gt; Those opposed to including the article raised compelling arguments, pointing out that key congressional leaders of both political parties had been privy to the information and had neither said anything to the rest of Congress nor done anything about it, contending that the president's actions had been appropriate uses of his [[Powers of the president of the United States#Commander-in-chief|power as Commander-in-chief]], and noting that this particular congressional-authority versus presidential-authority dispute had already been addressed by the [[War Powers Resolution]] (passed over Nixon's veto one year earlier). Another factor working against the proposal was the realization that putting the Cambodia article before the full House would interject the volatile issue of the [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|role of the U.S. military in the Vietnam War]] into the impeachment debate.&lt;ref name=123124Labovitz1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2failed/&gt;

==== Emoluments and tax fraud ====

Lastly, [[Edward Mezvinsky]] introduced an article charging that improvements made to Nixon's private homes at [[San Clemente, California]] and [[Key Biscayne, Florida]] at government expense constituted a violation of the Domestic Emoluments Clause, and also that his acknowledged underpayment of federal income taxes between 1969 and 1972 constituted willful tax evasion.&lt;ref name="nyt-art3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=123124Labovitz1978/&gt; Mezvinsky asserted that Nixon "took advantage of the Presidency to avoid paying proper taxes." Nixon's [[Malfeasance in office|malfeasance since entering office]] was a "serious threat to our tax system," he said, because "we expect the law to be applied equally to every taxpayer."&lt;ref name=NYT2failed/&gt; After a debate scheduled by the committee's leaders so as to reach the prime‐time television audience, the article was rejected, also by a 12–26 margin.&lt;ref name="nyt-art3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=politico073014/&gt;

Those opposed to its inclusion as part of the impeachment resolution raised several objections. On the emoluments charge they pointed out that the property improvements made at the president's Florida and California residences had been made at the request of the [[U.S. Secret Service]] and contended that there was no direct evidence to show that the president knew that government money was being spent on the projects. On the taxes charge it was argued that there insufficient evidence to prove an intent to defraud, and that the alleged crime was not an impeachable offense as it did not involve an abuse of presidential power.&lt;ref name=123124Labovitz1978/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2failed/&gt;

== Text of articles reported to the House ==

The Judiciary Committee agreed to three articles of impeachment against President Nixon. Together they were a sharp rebuke of his conduct in office, as each one concluded with the same declaration, that:

{{quote|In all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore Richard M. Nixon, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.&lt;ref name=CRS98-763/&gt;&lt;ref name=HDoc109153/&gt;}}

The committee finished its work on July 30, 1974, two years, one month and 13 days after the Watergate break-in.&lt;ref name=7defect/&gt; "By its diligence and the bipartisan magnitude of its vote," ''Time'' Magazine wrote a few days later, "the House Judiciary Committee has virtually assured a substantial, bipartisan vote for impeachment in the full House. That in turn is sure to have an impact on the Senate, as will public opinion."&lt;ref name=Fateful08051974Time/&gt; Nixon resigned from office on August 9, 1974, before the House received the committee's recommendation for action.

=== Article I ===

Article I, charging Nixon with obstruction of justice, alleged in part that:

{{quote|On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence. Subsequent thereto, Richard M. Nixon, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede, and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entry; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.&lt;ref name=CRS98-763/&gt;&lt;ref name=HDoc109153/&gt;}}

The article also specified nine ways by which the president was alleged to have carried out the plan to obstruct the investigation.&lt;ref name="nyt-art1"/&gt;

=== Article II ===

Article II, charging Nixon with abuse of power, alleged in part that:

{{quote|Using the powers of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purposes of these agencies.&lt;ref name=CRS98-763/&gt;&lt;ref name=HDoc109153/&gt;}}

The article also cited five specific examples of alleged misconduct to substantiate this charge against the president.&lt;ref name="nyt-art2"/&gt;

=== Article III ===

Article III, charging Nixon with contempt of Congress alleged in part that:

{{quote|In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 11, 1974, May 15, 1974, May 30, 1974, and June 24, 1974, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas. The subpoenaed papers and things were deemed necessary by the Committee in order to resolve by direct evidence fundamental, factual questions relating to Presidential direction, knowledge or approval of actions demonstrated by other evidence to be substantial grounds for impeachment of the President. In refusing to produce these papers and things Richard M. Nixon, substituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=CRS98-763/&gt;&lt;ref name=HDoc109153/&gt;}}

== Nixon's support in Congress deteriorates ==

Despite "a triple whammy" of events in late July—the widely-covered Judiciary Committee hearings, the Supreme Court's order to surrender the tapes, and six Republican defections—Nixon, according to White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig, had not "changed one iota his sense of self‐confidence and sense of determination to see this thing through."&lt;ref name=PS07291974NYT/&gt; He was closely studying the possible vote counts that impeachment in the House or trial in the Senate would get; Henry Kissinger later sympathetically described the president at this time as "a man awake in his own nightmare."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kissinger|1982}}, p. 1181.&lt;/ref&gt; Republican leaders in Congress were also estimating vote counts. During a July 29 meeting between House Minority Leader John Rhodes and Senate Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]], Rhodes estimated that impeachment in the House would get as many as 300 votes (well more than the 218 needed) and Scott surmised that there were 60 votes for conviction in the Senate (a little short of 67 necessary). Both felt that the situation was deteriorating for the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|Bernstein|2005}}, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public support for the president was also deteriorating. A Harris Poll completed August 3 found that two‐thirds (66%) of the American public "believe that President Nixon should be impeached over Watergate scandals and tried." The "pro‐impeachment" total had increased by 13 percentage points during the course of the Judiciary Committee's televised debate and votes on the articles of impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;| title=Two‐Thirds in Poll Back Impeachment of Nixon| page=15| newspaper=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/05/archives/twothirds-in-poll-back-impeachment-of-nixon.html| date=August 5, 1974| agency=Reuters| accessdate=December 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrangements for impeachment vote and trial ===

On August 2, the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]] announced that the Judiciary Committee's report on the three articles of impeachment would be completed by August 8, and that the House would begin debating them on August 19.&lt;ref name=NixonTrial-NCC/&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported on August 7 that the members of the Democratic and Republican leadership had agreed informally to cut in half the time for debating impeachment on the House floor. Thus the televised debate would have lasted for one week rather than two.&lt;ref name=Rhodes08071974Curtail&gt;{{cite news| title=Rhodes Will Vote To Impeach; House To curtail Debate| last1=Lyons| first1=Richard L.| last2=Chapman| first2=William| date=August 7, 1974| page=1| newspaper=The Washington Post| url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Watergate/Watergate%20Items%2017131%20to%2017456/Watergate%2017408.pdf| accessdate=November 20, 2019| via=The Weisberg Collection, Hood College, Frederick, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the Judiciary Committee approved the first article of impeachment, Senate Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] and Senator Scott met to start planning for a likely impeachment trial.&lt;ref name=NixonTrial-NCC&gt;{{cite web| title=What would a Nixon impeachment trial have looked like?| date=July 28, 2017 | last=Bomboy| first=Scott| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/what-would-a-nixon-impeachment-trial-have-looked-like| work=Constitution Daily| publisher=National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| accessdate=October 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100 senators would have served as jurors, with Chief Justice Burger presiding; a group of House members would have prosecuted, Nixon's lawyers defending.&lt;ref name="nyt-art1"/&gt; Following a [[Continuance|delay]] to give the president time to prepare,&lt;ref name="nyt-art1"/&gt; the actual trial, according to Senator [[Jacob Javits]], was unlikely to start before November and might run well into January 1975.&lt;ref name=K-Jul1974&gt;{{harvnb|Kissinger|1982}}, pp. 1193–1194.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis R. Valeo]], the [[Secretary of the United States Senate|secretary of the U.S. Senate]], was put in charge of making the arrangements. It was decided that there would be television coverage of the trial, and technical preparations and discussions of specific ground rules for the press and the public were underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Valeo |first=Francis R. |subjectlink=Francis R.

=== The "smoking gun" tape===

President Nixon complied with the Supreme Court order to deliver all subpoenaed tape recordings to Watergate investigators on July 30.&lt;ref name=Burglary2004CNN/&gt; White House secretaries prepared verbatim transcripts, and in accordance with Judge Sirica's order, copies went to St. Clair—who had not previously listened to any of the tapes, as Nixon had never granted him access.&lt;ref name=Unmaking08191974Time&gt;{{Cite magazine| title=The Unmaking of the President| url=https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/back.time/9608/21/index.shtml| date=August 19, 1974| magazine=Time| location=New York, New York| volume=104| issue=8| accessdate=November 17, 2019| via=CNN AllPolitics-Back in Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; When transcripts were made public on August 5, a conversation on one, recorded June 23, 1972, only a few days after the break-in at the Democratic National Committee offices, proved that Nixon's assertion of having had no involvement in the cover-up was a lie.&lt;ref name=Ambrose414416&gt;{{harvnb|Ambrose 1991}}, pp. 414–416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nixonslast&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Last Hours of the Nixon Presidency| last=Klein| first=Christopher| date=August 30, 2018| url=https://www.history.com/news/the-last-hours-of-the-nixon-presidency-40-years-ago| website=history.com| orig-year=Original date: August 8, 2014| publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks| accessdate=October 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape, later known as the [[Nixon White House tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|"smoking gun" tape]], documented the initial stages of the Watergate cover-up. On it, Nixon and then-Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman are heard formulating a plan to block investigations by having the CIA falsely claim to the FBI that national security was involved. This demonstrated both that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and that he had approved plans to thwart the investigation.&lt;ref name="nixonresigns"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politico08052018/&gt; In a statement accompanying the release of the tape, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, saying he had a lapse of memory.&lt;ref name=Ambrose414416/&gt;&lt;ref name=RefusalSpeechWAPO&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!-- staff; no by-line. --&gt;| agency=[[Associated Press|AP]]| title=Refusal-to-Resign Speech Was Prepared for Nixon| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/nixon/stories/nixon121696ap.htm| date=December 16, 1996| newspaper=The Washington Post| accessdate=November 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political fallout ===

The following morning, August 6, Nixon attempted to rally his Cabinet's continued support. "In my opinion and in the opinion of my counsel, I have not committed any impeachable offense," he asserted. Therefore, he declared, "the constitutional process should be followed out to the end—wherever the end may be."&lt;ref name=Unmaking08191974Time&gt;{{Cite magazine| title=The Unmaking of the President| url=https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/analysis/back.time/9608/21/index.shtml| date=August 19, 1974| magazine=Time| location=New York, New York| volume=104| issue=8| accessdate=November 17, 2019| via=CNN AllPolitics-Back in Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Vice President Ford, who had been crisscrossing the nation for months speaking in defense of the president,&lt;ref name=Ford08071974NYT&gt;{{cite news| title=Ford Shuttles Between the Capitol and White House| last=Hunter| first=Marjorie| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/07/archives/ford-shuttles-between-the-capitol-and-white-house-avoids-comment.html| date=August 7, 1974| page=16| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=December 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; told Nixon that while he would continue to support Nixon's policies, he would no longer speak to the media or to the public on the subject of impeachment;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ford|1979}}, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Ford had issued a statement the previous evening saying he would "respectfully decline to discuss impeachment matters in public or in response to questions until the facts are more fully available."&lt;ref name=Ford08071974NYT/&gt;

Confronted with the incontrovertible fact that Nixon had played a leading role in the Watergate cover-up from its initial stages, the ranks of Nixon's defenders in Congress thinned rapidly.&lt;ref name="nixonresigns"/&gt; Various Senate Republicans expressed their "shock or outrage" and echoed the growing sentiment favoring the president's resignation.&lt;ref name=ResignationUrged&gt;{{cite news| title=Resignation Urged By GOP Senators| last=Rich| first=Spencer| date=August 7, 1974| page=1| url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Watergate/Watergate%20Items%2017131%20to%2017456/Watergate%2017417.pdf| newspaper=The Washington Post| accessdate=November 17, 2019| via=The Weisberg Collection, Hood College, Frederick, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pointed statement, [[Robert P.

There was a continuous barrage of similar public declarations throughout the day by various House Republicans. Minority Leader Rhodes, declared: "Cover-up of criminal activity and misuse of federal agencies can neither be condoned nor tolerated." He vowed that: "When the roll is called in the House of Representatives, I will vote 'aye' on impeachment."&lt;ref name=RhodesObit&gt;{{cite news| last=Barnes| first=Bart| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/john-j-rhodes-dies-led-gop-in-house-during-watergate/2012/06/05/gJQA84nSGV_story.html| title=John J.

It was now clear to him that the president had a "plan of action" to cover up the break-in. "These facts standing alone," he continued, "are legally sufficient in my opinion to sustain at least one count against the president of conspiracy to obstruct justice."&lt;ref name="nyt-wiggins-aug6"/&gt; "Devastating—impeachable," Charles Sandman told reporters (now having the "specificity" he had demanded during the hearings).&lt;ref name=Unmaking08191974Time/&gt;

Among the few Republicans on Capitol Hill who still defended the president following the "smoking gun" revelation was Senator [[Carl Curtis]], who implored Congress not to panic. He warned that the United States would become like a "banana republic" if Nixon was ousted in favor of Vice President Ford, who in turn would then select someone to fill the vice presidential slot. He said "this would mean both Ford and the new Vice President would be men who hadn't been elected to their high office, but merely nominated by a president under procedures for filling the vice presidency when it is vacant."&lt;ref name=ResignationUrged/&gt; Congressman [[Earl Landgrebe]] did as well, declaring: "Don't confuse me with the facts.

== Resignation and conclusion ==

[[File:Nixon Resign.ogg|thumb|Nixon announces that he will resign]]
[[File:NIXONSandFORDS.jpg|thumb|upright=1|President Nixon and the first lady (in pink) leave the White House, accompanied by Vice President Ford and the second lady, August 9, 1974, shortly before Nixon's resignation [[Coming into force|became effective]]]]

Nixon met with Vice President Ford the following morning, August 8, to inform Ford of his intention to resign from office,&lt;ref name=Nixonslast/&gt; and met with congressional leaders that evening to give them formal notice.&lt;ref name=CA1990Giant/&gt; Next, he met briefly with a group of longtime congressional friends, and then [[Richard Nixon's resignation speech|he informed the nation]].&lt;ref name=Nixonslast/&gt; Several days earlier, in advance of the release of the tapes on August 5, presidential speechwriter [[Ray Price (speechwriter)|Ray Price]] had prepared two draft speeches for the president—one, a refusal-to-resign speech, and the second, a resignation speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Small|1999}}, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter served as the first draft of the speech Nixon delivered live on radio and television from the Oval Office that night.&lt;ref name=RefusalSpeechWAPO/&gt;

In his address, Nixon said he was resigning because "I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the nation would require." He also stated his hope that, by resigning, "I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America." He then went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency, especially in foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ambrose|1991}}, pp. 435–436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kutler|1990}}, pp. 547–549.&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon acknowledged that some of his judgments "were wrong," and he expressed contrition, saying: "I deeply regret any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision." The speech contained no admission of wrongdoing, however, nor did it mention the articles of impeachment pending against him.&lt;ref name="nixonresigns"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2007}}, p. 983.&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters outside the White House along [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] shouted "{{hsp}}jail to the chief{{hsp}}" throughout the night.&lt;ref name=Nixonslast/&gt;

On the morning of August 9, 1974, after an emotional farewell to his Cabinet members and staff, Nixon and his family left the White House for San Clemente, California. He left behind a signed letter of resignation addressed to Secretary of State Kissinger,&lt;ref name=Nixonslast/&gt; becoming the first U.S. president to resign from office.&lt;ref name=JS11152019CBS/&gt;&lt;ref name="nixonresigns"/&gt; His presidency officially ended at 11:35 am, when Kissinger received the letter, and Ford's began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;| title=News Summary and Index Saturday, August 10, 1974: The presidency| date=August 10, 1974| page=31| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/10/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-the-presidency.html| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=October 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short while later, in the [[East Room]] of the White House, [[Inauguration of Gerald Ford|Ford was sworn into office]] by Chief Justice Burger, declaring "our long national nightmare is over."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Small|1999}}, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epilogue ==

Though Nixon had not faced impeachment by the full House or a Senate trial, criminal prosecution was still a possibility at both the federal and state levels.&lt;ref name=TimeLegal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942980,00.html |title=The Legal Aftermath Citizen Nixon and the Law |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about Nixon's well-being, and worried that the "ugly passions" aroused by the Watergate scandal would rise again during a lengthy Nixon prosecution, on September 8, 1974, President Ford granted [[Pardon of Richard Nixon|Nixon a pardon]] for all crimes he had "committed or may have committed or taken part in" as president.&lt;ref name="nixonresigns"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanderVoort4aftermath&gt;{{Cite web| last=van der Voort| first=Tom| title=Watergate: The Aftermath| url=https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/educational-resources/watergate/watergate-aftermath| work=The Presidency Educational Resources| publisher=The Miller Center, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=October 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon, in his official acceptance of the pardon, said that he "was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| editor1-last=Fulton| editor1-first=Mary Lou| url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-17-ss-339-story.html| title=Nixon Library: Nixon Timeline| work=Los Angeles Times| date=July 17, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; While accepting the pardon implied an admission of guilt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Vande Bunte| first=Matt| title=President Nixon didn't want to be pardoned, Watergate expert says| date=April 3, 2019| orig-year=October 20, 2014| url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2014/10/president_nixon_didnt_want_to.html| website=MLive.com| publisher=MLive Media Group| location=Grand Rapids, Michigan| accessdate=December 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon maintained his innocence until his death in 1994.

Public opinion at the time of the pardon was negative according to a September 6–9, 1974 Gallup Poll, which found that "only 38 percent of Americans said Ford should pardon Nixon, while 53 percent said he should not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Newport| first1=Frank| last2=Carroll| first2=Joseph| date=March 9, 2007| title=Americans Generally Negative on Recent Presidential Pardons| url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/26830/americans-generally-negative-recent-presidential-pardons.aspx| publisher=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=November 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous congressional Democrats issued statements critical of the pardon, and in light of it, some even sought to reopen the impeachment process against the former president. Specifically, Judiciary Committee members [[Jerome Waldie]], George Danielson, and [[Don Edwards]] spoke of pressing the committee to pursue the outstanding subpoenas in order to bring all the evidence out into the open and to complete the formal record of Nixon's wrongdoing while in office. Chairman Rodino, however, declared that "impeachment is dead," forestalling such a move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Rodino Rejects Revival of Impeachment| last=Rosenbaum| first=David E.| date=September 10, 1974| page=1| newspaper=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/10/archives/rodino-rejects-revival-of-impeachment-rodino-bars-impeachment-move.html| accessdate=December 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, Ford appeared voluntarily before the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Criminal Justice to explain the reasons behind the pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Greene| first=John Robert| title=Gerald Ford: Domestic Affairs| url=https://millercenter.org/president/ford/domestic-affairs| publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=January 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, lingering public resentment over the Nixon pardon was a factor in Ford's narrow loss to Democratic Party nominee [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=vanderVoort4aftermath/&gt;

Nationwide, the 1974 [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] was a landslide victory for the Democratic Party. In the House, Democrats won 49 seats previously held by Republicans and increased their majority above the [[Supermajority|two-thirds]] mark. Altogether, there were 93 [[Freshmen|freshmen representatives]] in the [[94th United States Congress|94th Congress]] when it convened on January 3, 1975, 76 of them Democrats. Those elected to office that year later came to be known collectively as "[[Watergate Babies]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=How the 'Watergate Babies' Broke American Politics| last=Lawrence| first=John A.| date=May 26, 2018| url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/26/congress-broke-american-politics-218544| work=Politico Magazine| accessdate=October 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Republican Judiciary Committee members were defeated in the [[1974 United States House of Representatives elections|1974 elections]] by their Democratic opponents.

Regarding the Judiciary Committee's process and its momentous recommendation that President Nixon be impeached and removed from office, Rodino, in a 1989 interview with [[Susan Stamberg]] of [[National Public Radio]], said:

{{quote|Notwithstanding the fact that I was a Democrat, notwithstanding the fact that there were many who thought that Rodino wanted to bring down a president as a Democrat, you know, he was our president. And this is our system that was being tested. And here was a man who had achieved the highest office that anyone could gift him with, you know. And you're bringing down the presidency of the United States, and it was a sad, sad commentary on our whole history and, of course, on Richard Nixon.&lt;ref name=NPR05092005/&gt;}}

{{Watergate}}

The '''Watergate scandal''' was a major [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|federal political scandal]] in the [[United States]] involving the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon#Administration|administration]] of [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Richard Nixon]] from 1972 to 1974 that resulted in the end of Nixon's presidency. The scandal stemmed from the June 17, 1972, break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) headquarters at the [[Watergate Office Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], by five men and the Nixon administration's subsequent attempts to cover up its involvement in the crime. Soon after the perpetrators were arrested, the press and the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] discovered a connection between cash found on them at the time and a [[slush fund]] used by the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President|Nixon re-election campaign committee]].&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu"&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=James M.

Further investigations, along with revelations during subsequent trials of the burglars in January 1973, led the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to grant its [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]] additional investigation authority to probe into "certain matters within its jurisdiction,"&lt;ref name=R45769&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45769| title=The Impeachment Process in the House of Representatives| date=October 10, 2019| last1=Rybicki| first1=Elizabeth| last2=Greene| first2=Michael| work=CRS Report for Congress| publisher=Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress| location=Washington, D.C.| id=R45769| pages=5–7| accessdate=November 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=H.Res.74 – 93rd Congress, 1st Session| url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-resolution/74/actions| website=congress.gov| accessdate=October 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] to create a special investigative committee to look into the scandal. The resultant [[United States Senate Watergate Committee|Senate Watergate hearings]] commenced in May 1973. Broadcast "gavel-to-gavel" nationwide, by [[PBS]], the hearings aroused great public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/watergate/watergate-and-public-broadcasting "'Gavel-to-Gavel': The Watergate Scandal and Public Television", ''American Archive of Public Broadcasting''.

Several major revelations and egregious presidential action against the investigation later in 1973 prompted the House to commence an [[impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment process against Nixon]] in February 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classes.lls.edu/archive/manheimk/371d1/nixonarticles.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303075538/http://classes.lls.edu/archive/manheimk/371d1/nixonarticles.html|archive-date=March 3, 2017|date=Spring 1999|work=Impeachment Seminar|title=Nixon Articles of Impeachment |first=Karl|last=Manheim |first2=Lawrence B.|last2=Solum}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, 1974, while the impeachment process was under way, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] unanimously ruled in ''[[United States v.

The tapes revealed that Nixon had conspired to cover up activities that took place after the break-in and had attempted to use federal officials to deflect the investigation.&lt;ref name="smoking gun tape"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Smoking Gun Tape | format =Transcript of the recording of a meeting between President Nixon and H.

With his complicity in the cover-up made public and his political support completely eroded, Nixon resigned from office on August 9, 1974.

Altogether, the scandal resulted in the [[Indictment#United States|indictment]] of 69 people. Trials or [[plea]]s resulted in 48 people—many of them top Nixon administration officials—being found guilty.&lt;ref name=convictions/&gt; The term ''Watergate'', by [[metonymy]], came to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration.

On January 27, 1972, [[G. Gordon Liddy]], Finance Counsel for the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]] (CRP) and former aide to [[John Ehrlichman]], presented a campaign intelligence plan to CRP's Acting Chairman [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]], Attorney General [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]], and Presidential Counsel [[John Dean]] that involved extensive illegal activities against the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. According to Dean, this marked "the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dean|first1=John W.|title=The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It|page=xvii|publisher=Viking|date=2014|isbn=978-0-670-02536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell viewed the plan as unrealistic. Two months later, Mitchell approved a [[Operation Gemstone|reduced version]] of the plan, including burgling the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s (DNC) headquarters at the [[Watergate Complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]—ostensibly to photograph campaign documents and install listening devices in telephones. Liddy was nominally in charge of the operation,{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} but has since insisted that he was duped by both Dean and at least two of his subordinates, which included former CIA officers [[E. Howard Hunt]] and [[James W. McCord, Jr.|James McCord]], the latter of whom was serving as then-CRP Security Coordinator after John Mitchell had by then resigned as Attorney General to become the CRP chairman.&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;&lt;ref name=nixonmitchell&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/stories/mitchobit.htm|first=Lawrence|last=Meyer|title=John N.

In May, McCord assigned former FBI agent [[Alfred C. Baldwin III]] to carry out the wiretapping and monitor the telephone conversations afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rugaber|first=Walter|title=Watergate Trial in Closed Session|work=The New York Times|date=January 18, 1973|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/18/archives/watergate-trial-in-closed-session-judge-clears-court-to-hear.html|access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCord testified that he selected Baldwin's name from a registry published by the [[Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI's Society of Former Special Agents]] to work for the Committee to re-elect President Nixon.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Baldwin first served as bodyguard to [[Martha Mitchell]]—John Mitchell's wife, who was living in Washington.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Baldwin accompanied Martha Mitchell to Chicago.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Eventually the Committee replaced Baldwin with another security man.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

On May 11, McCord arranged for Baldwin, whom investigative reporter [[Jim Hougan]] described as "somehow special and perhaps well known to McCord",{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} to stay at the Howard Johnson's motel across the street from the Watergate complex.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Room 419 was booked in the name of McCord's company.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} At behest of Liddy and Hunt, McCord and his team of burglars prepared for their first Watergate break-in, which began on May 28.&lt;ref&gt;G Gordon Liddy ( 1980).

Two phones inside the DNC headquarters' offices were said to have been [[wiretapped]].&lt;ref name=mccordreturns /&gt; One was [[Robert Spencer Oliver]]'s phone. At the time, Oliver was working as the executive director of the Association of State Democratic Chairmen. The other phone belonged to DNC chairman [[Larry O'Brien]]. The FBI found no evidence that O'Brien's phone was bugged;{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} however, it was determined that an effective listening device was installed in Oliver's phone. While successful with installing the listening devices, the Committee agents soon determined that they needed repairs. They plotted a second "burglary" in order to take care of the situation.&lt;ref name="mccordreturns"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/15/us/watergate-then-now-2-decades-after-political-burglary-questions-still-linger.html|title=Watergate, Then and Now – 2 Decades After a Political Burglary, the Questions Still Linger|first=Robert|last=Pear|work=The New York Times|date=June 14, 1992|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after midnight on Saturday, June 17, 1972, Watergate Complex security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] noticed tape covering the [[Latch (hardware)|latches]] on some of the complex's doors leading from the underground parking garage to several offices, which allowed the doors to close but stay unlocked.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} He removed the tape, believing it was nothing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/12/22/the-post-and-the-forgotten-security-guard-who-discovered-the-watergate-break-in/|title='The Post' and the forgotten security guard who discovered the Watergate break-in|last=Brown|first=DeNeen|date=2017|website=The Washington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned a short time later and discovered that someone had retaped the locks, he called the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Responding to the call was an unmarked car with three plainclothes officers working the overnight "bum squad"—dressed as hippies and on the lookout for drug deals and other street crimes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} The burglars' sentry across the street, Alfred Baldwin, was distracted watching TV and failed to observe the arrival of the police car in front of the hotel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} Neither did he see the plainclothes officers investigating the DNC's sixth floor suite of 29 offices.

McCord, Jr.|James McCord]], [[Eugenio Martínez]], and [[Frank Sturgis]].&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt; They were charged with attempted burglary and attempted interception of telephone and other communications. ''The Washington Post'' reported that "police found lock-picks and door jimmies, almost $2,300 in cash, most of it in $100 bills with the serial numbers in sequence&amp;nbsp;... a short wave receiver that could pick up police calls, 40 rolls of unexposed film, two 35 millimeter cameras and three pen-sized tear gas guns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Alfred E.|title=5 Held in Plot to Bug Democrats' Office Here|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/05/31/AR2005111001227.html|accessdate=December 28, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=June 18, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning, Sunday, June 18, G. Gordon Liddy called Jeb Magruder in Los Angeles and informed him that "the four men arrested with McCord were Cuban freedom fighters, whom Howard Hunt recruited". Initially, Nixon's organization and the White House quickly went to work to cover up the crime and any evidence that might have damaged the president and his reelection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Genovese|first1=Michael A.|title=The Watergate Crisis|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CN|isbn=978-0313298783|url=https://archive.org/details/watergatecrisis00geno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover-up and its unraveling==
===Initial cover-up===
[[File:Address Book of Watergate Burglar Bernard Barker, Discovered in a Room at the Watergate Hotel, June 18, 1972 - NARA - 304966.tif|thumb|Address book of Watergate burglar Bernard Barker, discovered in a room at the Watergate Hotel, June 18, 1972]]

Within hours of the burglars' arrest, the FBI discovered [[E. Howard Hunt]]'s name in Barker and Martínez's address books. Nixon administration officials were concerned because Hunt and Liddy were also involved in a separate secret activity known as the "[[White House Plumbers]]", which was established to stop security "[[News leak|leaks]]" and investigate other sensitive security matters. Dean later testified that top Nixon aide [[John Ehrlichman]] ordered him to "[[wikt:deep six|deep six]]" the contents of Howard Hunt's White House safe. Ehrlichman subsequently denied this. In the end, Dean and the FBI's Acting Director [[L. Patrick Gray]] (in separate operations) destroyed the evidence from Hunt's safe.

Nixon's own reaction to the break-in, at least initially, was one of skepticism. Watergate prosecutor James Neal was sure that Nixon had not known in advance of the break-in. As evidence, he cited a conversation taped on June 23 between the President and his Chief of Staff, [[H. R. Haldeman]], in which Nixon asked, "Who was the asshole that did that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transcript Of A Recording Of A Meeting Between The President And H.R.

A few days later, Nixon's Press Secretary, [[Ron Ziegler]], described the event as "a third-rate burglary attempt". On August 29, at a news conference, Nixon stated that Dean had conducted a thorough investigation of the incident, when Dean had actually not conducted any investigations at all. Nixon furthermore said, "I can say categorically that&amp;nbsp;... no one in the White House staff, no one in this Administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident." On September 15, Nixon congratulated Dean, saying, "The way you've handled it, it seems to me, has been very skillful, because you—putting your fingers in the dikes every time that leaks have sprung here and sprung there."&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;

This money (and several other checks which had been lawfully donated to the CRP) had been directly used to finance the burglary and wiretapping expenses, including hardware and supplies.

Mr. Barker's multiple national and international businesses all had separate bank accounts, which he was found to have attempted to use to disguise the true origin of the money being paid to the burglars. The donor's checks demonstrated the burglars' direct link to the finance committee of the CRP.

Donations totalling $86,000 (${{Inflation|US|86000|1972|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) were made by individuals who were deluded that they were making private donations by certified and cashier's checks for the president's re-election. Investigators' examination of the bank records of a Miami company run by Watergate burglar Barker revealed an account controlled by him personally had deposited a check and then transferred it (through the [[Federal Reserve System#Check clearing system|Federal Reserve Check Clearing System]]).

The banks that had originated the checks were keen to ensure the depository institution used by Barker had acted properly in ensuring the checks had been received and endorsed by the check's payee, before its acceptance for deposit in Bernard Barker's account. Only in this way would the issuing banks not be held liable for the unauthorized and improper release of funds from their customers' accounts.

The investigation by the FBI, which cleared Barker's bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication of members of the CRP, to whom the checks had been delivered. Those individuals were the Committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, [[Hugh Sloan]].

As a private organization, the committee followed the normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individuals to accept and endorse checks on behalf of the Committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the Committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to do that. When confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that committee deputy director [[Jeb Magruder]] and finance director [[Maurice Stans]] had directed him to give the money to [[G. Gordon Liddy]].

Liddy, in turn, gave the money to Barker and attempted to hide its origin. Barker tried to disguise the funds by depositing them into accounts in banks outside of the United States. Unbeknownst to Barker, Liddy, and Sloan, the complete record of all such transactions was held for roughly six months. Barker's use of foreign banks in April and May 1972, to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier's checks and money orders, resulted in the banks keeping the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.

All five Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 CRP, thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Quote: "There were still simply too many unanswered questions in the case. By that time, thinking about the break-in and reading about it, I'd have had to be some kind of moron to believe that no other people were involved. No political campaign committee would turn over so much money to a man like Gordon Liddy without someone higher up in the organization approving the transaction. How could I not see that? These questions about the case were on my mind during a pretrial session in my courtroom on December 4."

On September 29, 1972, the press reported that John Mitchell, while serving as Attorney General, controlled a secret Republican fund used to finance intelligence-gathering against the Democrats. On October 10, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported that the FBI had determined that the Watergate break-in was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee. Despite these revelations, Nixon's campaign was never seriously jeopardized; on November 7, the [[1972 United States presidential election|President was re-elected]] in one of the biggest landslides in American political history.

===Role of the media===
The connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political and legal repercussions. Relying heavily upon [[anonymous sources]], ''Post'' reporters [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the upper reaches of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed [[Judy Hoback Miller]], the bookkeeper for Nixon's re-election campaign, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/06/woodward-and-bernstein-downplay-deep-throat-125950.html "Woodward Downplays Deep Throat"], Politico.com blog, June 2012. Retrieved February 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /&gt;
[[File:Watergate garage with historic marker.jpg|thumb|Garage in Rosslyn where Woodward and Felt met. Also visible is the historical marker erected by the county to note its significance.]]

Chief among the ''Post's'' anonymous sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant was identified as [[William Mark Felt, Sr.]], deputy director of the FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt's involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate as extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage somewhere in [[Rosslyn, Virginia|Rosslyn]] over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted [[News leak|leaks]] about Watergate with [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], the ''[[Washington Daily News]]'' and other publications.&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/2012/02/19/the-profound-lies-of-deep-throat_2012-02-19/ "The profound lies of Deep Throat"], ''The Miami Herald'', republished in Portland Press Herald, February 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

During this early period, most of the media failed to understand the full implications of the scandal, and concentrated reporting on other topics related to the 1972 presidential election.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943934-1,00.html |title=Covering Watergate: Success and Backlash |work=Time |date=July 8, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most outlets ignored or downplayed Woodward and Bernstein's scoops; the crosstown ''[[Washington Star-News]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' even ran stories incorrectly discrediting the ''Post's'' articles. After the ''Post'' revealed that [[H.R. Haldeman]] made payments from the secret fund, newspapers like the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' failed to publish the information, but did publish the White House's denial of the story the following day.&lt;ref name="BoysontheBus"&gt;Crouse, Timothy (1973).''The Boys on the Bus'', Random House, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; The White House also sought to isolate the ''Post's'' coverage by tirelessly attacking that newspaper while declining to criticize other damaging stories about the scandal from the [[New York Times]] and [[Time Magazine]].&lt;ref name="BoysontheBus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /&gt;

After it was learned that one of the convicted burglars wrote to Judge Sirica alleging a high-level cover-up, the media shifted its focus. ''Time'' magazine described Nixon as undergoing "daily hell and very little trust". The distrust between the press and the Nixon administration was mutual and greater than usual due to lingering dissatisfaction with events from the [[Vietnam War]]. At the same time, public distrust of the media was polled at more than 40%.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt;

Nixon and top administration officials discussed using government agencies to "get" (or retaliate against) those they perceived as hostile media organizations.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt; Such actions had been taken before. At the request of Nixon's White House in 1969, the FBI tapped the phones of five reporters. In 1971, the White House requested an audit of the tax return of the editor of ''[[Newsday]]'', after he wrote a series of articles about the financial dealings of [[Charles Rebozo|Charles "Bebe" Rebozo]], a friend of Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911434-3,00.html |title=The Nation: More Evidence: Huge Case for Judgment|work=Time |date=July 29, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Administration and its supporters accused the media of making "wild accusations", putting too much emphasis on the story, and of having a liberal bias against the Administration.&lt;ref name="watergate_case_study_jm_perry_columbia_edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt; Nixon said in a May 1974 interview with supporter [[Baruch Korff]] that if he had followed the liberal policies that he thought the media preferred, "Watergate would have been a blip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942981-11,00.html |title=The Nixon Years: Down from the Mountaintop |work=Time |date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media noted that most of the reporting turned out to be accurate; the competitive nature of the media guaranteed widespread coverage of the far-reaching political scandal.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt;

Applications to [[journalism schools]] reached an all-time high in 1974.&lt;ref name=TimeWatergateCoverage /&gt;

===Scandal escalates===
Rather than ending with the conviction and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, the investigation into the break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. "Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only did he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so in a way that was least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, John W. (2014). ''The Nixon Defense'', p. 344, Penguin Group, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar [[James W. McCord Jr.|James McCord]], who alleged that [[perjury]] had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. In an attempt to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.

Urged by Nixon, on March 28, aide John Ehrlichman told Attorney General [[Richard Kleindienst]] that nobody in the White House had prior knowledge of the burglary. On April 13, Magruder told U.S. attorneys that he had perjured himself during the burglars' trial, and implicated John Dean and John Mitchell.&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;

John Dean believed that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman could go to the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president's depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. He wondered if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, as if he were trying to prod attendees' recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, John W. (2014). ''The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It'', pp. 415–416, Penguin Group, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, Dean told Nixon that he had been cooperating with the [[U.S. attorneys]]. On that same day, U.S. attorneys told Nixon that Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean, and other White House officials were implicated in the cover-up.&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 In Review. |agency=United Press International |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Judge Sirica finished reading the letter, the courtroom exploded with excitement and reporters ran to the rear entrance to phone their newspapers. The bailiff kept banging for silence. It was a stunning development, exactly what I had been waiting for. Perjury at the trial. The involvement of others. It looked as if Watergate was about to break wide open."

On April 30, Nixon asked for the resignation of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, two of his most influential aides. They were both later indicted, convicted, and ultimately sentenced to prison. He asked for the resignation of Attorney General Kleindienst, to ensure no one could claim that his innocent friendship with Haldeman and Ehrlichman could be construed as a conflict. He fired [[White House Counsel]] John Dean, who went on to testify before the [[Senate Watergate Committee]] and said that he believed and suspected the conversations in the Oval Office were being taped. This information became the bombshell that helped force Richard Nixon to resign rather than be impeached.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, John W. (2014). ''The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It'', pp. 610–620, Penguin Group, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing from prison for ''New West'' and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazines in 1977, Ehrlichman claimed Nixon had offered him a large sum of money, which he declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918947-2,00.html "Sequels: Nixon: Once More, with Feeling"], ''Time'', May 16, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The President announced the resignations in an address to the American people:

{{quote|In one of the most difficult decisions of my Presidency, I accepted the resignations of two of my closest associates in the White House, Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, two of the finest public servants it has been my privilege to know. Because Attorney General Kleindienst, though a distinguished public servant, my personal friend for 20 years, with no personal involvement whatsoever in this matter has been a close personal and professional associate of some of those who are involved in this case, he and I both felt that it was also necessary to name a new Attorney General. The [[Counsel to the President]], John Dean, has also resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 in Review |agency=United Press International |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the same day, April 30, Nixon appointed a new attorney general, [[Elliot Richardson]], and gave him authority to designate a special counsel for the Watergate investigation who would be independent of the regular [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] hierarchy. In May 1973, Richardson named [[Archibald Cox]] to the position.&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective/&gt;

[[File:ThompsonWatergate.jpg|thumb|From left to right: minority counsel [[Fred Thompson]], [[ranking member]] [[Howard Baker]], and chair [[Sam Ervin]] of the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973]]

On February 7, 1973, the United States Senate voted 77-to-0 to approve 93 {{USBill|93|S. Res.|60}} and establish a select committee to investigate Watergate, with [[Sam Ervin]] named chairman the next day.&lt;ref Name=TimeRetrospective&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942983-1,00.html "Watergate Retrospective: The Decline and Fall"], ''Time'', August 19, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings held by the Senate committee, in which Dean and other former administration officials testified, were broadcast from May 17 to August 7, 1973. The three major networks of the time agreed to take turns covering the hearings live, each network thus maintaining coverage of the hearings every third day, starting with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on May 17 and ending with [[NBC]] on August 7. An estimated 85% of Americans with television sets tuned into at least one portion of the hearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =Ronald | last =Garay | url =http://www.museum.tv/eotv/watergate.htm | title =Watergate | website=The Museum of Broadcast Communication | accessdate =January 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, July 13, 1973, during a preliminary interview, deputy minority counsel [[Donald Sanders]] asked White House assistant [[Alexander Butterfield]] if there was any type of recording system in the White House.&lt;ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Butterfield said he was reluctant to answer, but finally admitted there was a new system in the White House that automatically recorded everything in the [[Oval Office]], the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]] and others, as well as Nixon's private office in the [[Old Executive Office Building]].

On Monday, July 16, 1973, in front of a live, televised audience, chief minority counsel [[Fred Thompson]] asked Butterfield whether he was "aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the President". Butterfield's revelation of the taping system transformed the Watergate investigation. Cox immediately subpoenaed the tapes, as did the Senate, but Nixon refused to release them, citing his [[executive privilege]] as president, and ordered Cox to drop his subpoena. Cox refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1973/Watergate-Scandal/12305770297723-4/ |title=Watergate Scandal, 1973 In Review |agency=United Press International |date=September 8, 1973 |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Saturday Night Massacre"===
{{Main|Saturday Night Massacre}}

On October 20, 1973, after Cox refused to drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General [[Elliot Richardson]] to fire the special prosecutor. Richardson resigned in protest rather than carry out the order. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General [[William Ruckelshaus]] to fire Cox, but Ruckelshaus also resigned rather than fire him. Nixon's search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] [[Robert Bork]]. Though Bork said he believed Nixon's order was valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being "perceived as a man who did the President's bidding to save my job".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/us/bork-irked-by-emphasis-on-his-role-in-watergate.html|title=Bork Irked by Emphasis on His Role in Watergate|last=Noble|first=Kenneth|date=July 2, 1987|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the special prosecutor.

These actions met considerable public criticism. Responding to the allegations of possible wrongdoing, in front of 400 [[Associated Press]] managing editors at [[Disney's Contemporary Resort]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pope|first1=Rich|title=Nixon, Watergate and Walt Disney World?

===Legal action against Nixon Administration members===
On March 1, 1974, a [[grand jury]] in Washington, D.C., indicted several former aides of Nixon, who became known as the "[[Watergate Seven]]"—[[H. R. Haldeman]], [[John Ehrlichman]], [[John N. Mitchell]], [[Charles Colson]], [[Gordon C. Strachan]], [[Robert Mardian]], and [[Kenneth Parkinson]]—for conspiring to hinder the Watergate investigation. The grand jury secretly named Nixon as an [[unindicted co-conspirator]]. The special prosecutor dissuaded them from an indictment of Nixon, arguing that a President can be indicted only after he leaves office.&lt;ref name=TimeLegal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942980,00.html |title=The Legal Aftermath Citizen Nixon and the Law |work=Time |date=August 19, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dean, [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]], and other figures had already pleaded guilty. On April 5, 1974, [[Dwight Chapin]], the former Nixon appointments secretary, was convicted of lying to the grand jury. Two days later, the same grand jury indicted [[Ed Reinecke]], the Republican [[Lieutenant Governor of California]], on three charges of perjury before the Senate committee.

===Release of the transcripts===
[[File:Nixon E2679c-09A.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|President Nixon explaining release of edited transcripts, April 29, 1974]]

The Nixon administration struggled to decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all pertinent information should be released. Whether to release unedited [[profanity]] and vulgarity divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary [[Ron Ziegler]] preferred using an edited version where "[[expletive deleted]]" would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced the release of the transcripts in a speech to the nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio pertinent to national security information could be [[redaction|redacted]] from the released tapes.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore White. ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1370091&amp;referer=brief_results Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon]''. Readers Digest Press, Athineum Publishers, 1975, pp. 296–298&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Nixon gained a positive reaction for his speech. As people read the transcripts over the next couple of weeks, however, former supporters among the public, media and political community called for Nixon's resignation or impeachment. Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] said, "While it may be easy to delete characterization from the printed page, we cannot delete characterization from people's minds with a wave of the hand."&lt;ref name=woodward/&gt; The Senate Republican Leader [[Hugh Scott]] said the transcripts revealed a "deplorable, disgusting, shabby, and immoral" performance on the part of the President and his former aides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1994-07-26/news/2994945_1_mr-scott-white-house-hugh-scott|title=Obituary: Hugh Scott, A Dedicated Public Servant
|newspaper=The Morning Call|date=July 26, 1994|accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House Republican Leader [[John Jacob Rhodes]] agreed with Scott, and Rhodes recommended that if Nixon's position continued to deteriorate, he "ought to consider resigning as a possible option".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19740510-01.2.43#|title=GOP Leaders Favour Stepdown|newspaper=The Stanford Daily|date=May 10, 1974 |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', a newspaper that had supported Nixon, wrote, "He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1123-2004Jun23.html|title=Obituary: Clayton Kirkpatrick, 89; Chicago Tribune Editor|author=Patricia Sullivan|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 24, 2004 |accessdate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Providence Journal]]'' wrote, "Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean."&lt;ref name=timemay20/&gt;&lt;!--COPY OF TIME EXCERPT: http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg-Watergate%20Files/Tapes%20Release/Tape%20Release%2039.pdf--&gt; This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to ''Time'' magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the [[Western United States|Western U.S.]] felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.&lt;ref name=timemay20&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601740520,00.html|title=Time Magazine |volume=103 |issue=20 |work=Time |date=May 20, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601740513,00.html |title=Time Magazine | volume= 103 |issue=19 |work=Time |date=May 13, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court===
The issue of access to the tapes went to the United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', the Court ruled unanimously (8–0) that claims of executive privilege over the tapes were void. (Then-Justice [[William Rehnquist]]—who had recently been appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered the President to release the tapes to the special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, Nixon complied with the order and released the subpoenaed tapes to the public.

===Release of the tapes===
The tapes revealed several crucial conversations&lt;ref&gt;Kutler, S. (1997). ''Abuse of Power'', p. 247. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; that took place between the President and his counsel, John Dean, on March 21, 1973. In this conversation, Dean summarized many aspects of the Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent cover-up, describing it as a "cancer on the presidency". The burglary team was being paid [[hush money]] for their silence and Dean stated: "That's the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [Haldeman] is involved in that; John [Ehrlichman] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that's an obstruction of justice." Dean continued, saying that Howard Hunt was blackmailing the White House demanding money immediately. Nixon replied that the money should be paid: "...&amp;nbsp; just looking at the immediate problem, don't you have to have—handle Hunt's financial situation damn soon?&amp;nbsp;... you've got to keep the cap on the bottle that much, in order to have any options".&lt;ref name="nixonlibrary.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/886-008.pdf |title=Transcript Prepared by the Impeachment Inquiry Staff for the House Judiciary Committee of a Recording of a Meeting Among the President, John Dean and H.R.

At the time of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and approved of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon's conversation with Haldeman on August 1, 1972, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: "Well&amp;nbsp;... they have to be paid. That's all there is to that. They have to be paid."&lt;ref&gt;Kutler, S. (1997). ''Abuse of Power'', p. 111. Simon &amp; Schuster, Transcribed conversation between President Nixon and Haldeman.&lt;/ref&gt; During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense.

New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 1973, investigators found that an [[18½ minute gap|{{frac|18|1|2}}-minute portion]] of one recorded tape had been erased. [[Rose Mary Woods]], Nixon's longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods to answer the phone while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later [[forensic]] analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clymer |first=Adam |title=National Archives Has Given Up on Filling the Nixon Tape Gap |work=The New York Times |date=May 9, 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/us/national-archives-has-given-up-on-filling-the-nixon-tape-gap.html |accessdate=January 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527231832/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/us/national-archives-has-given-up-on-filling-the-nixon-tape-gap.html |archivedate=May 27, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's position was becoming increasingly precarious. On February 6, 1974, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] approved {{USBill|93|H.

The Committee recommended the second article, [[abuse of power]], on July 29, 1974. The next day, on July 30, 1974, the Committee recommended the third article: [[contempt of Congress]]. On August 20, 1974, the House authorized the printing of the Committee report H. Rep. 93–1305, which included the text of the resolution impeaching Nixon and set forth articles of impeachment against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1974|H29219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Impeachment: An Overview of Constitutional Provisions, Procedure, and Practice | first= Elizabeth B | last= Bazan | date= December 9, 2010 | work= [[Congressional Research Service reports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 1974, the White House released a previously unknown audio tape from June 23, 1972. Recorded only a few days after the break-in, it documented the initial stages of the cover-up: it revealed Nixon and Haldeman had conducted a meeting in the Oval Office where they discussed how to stop the FBI from continuing their investigation of the break-in, as they recognised that there was a high risk that their position in the scandal may be revealed.

Haldeman introduced the topic as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...{{nbsp}}the Democratic break-in thing, we're back to the—in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because [[L. Patrick Gray|Gray]] doesn't exactly know how to control them, and they have&amp;nbsp;... their investigation is now leading into some productive areas&amp;nbsp;... and it goes in some directions we don't want it to go.&lt;ref name="haldeman6.23.72"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Members and staff of House Judiciary Committee 1974.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|House Judiciary Committee members and staff, 1974]]

After explaining how the money from CRP was traced to the burglars, Haldeman explained to Nixon the cover-up plan: "the way to handle this now is for us to have Walters [CIA] call Pat Gray [FBI] and just say, 'Stay the hell out of this&amp;nbsp;... this is ah, business here we don't want you to go any further on it.'"&lt;ref name="haldeman6.23.72"/&gt;

Nixon approved the plan, and after he was given more information about the involvement of his campaign in the break-in, he told Haldeman: "All right, fine, I understand it all. We won't second-guess Mitchell and the rest." Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: "You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That's the way they play it and that's the way we are going to play it."&lt;ref name="haldeman6.23.72"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/wspf/741-002.pdf |title="Transcript of a Recording of a Meeting Between the President and H.R.

Nixon denied that this constituted an obstruction of justice, as his instructions ultimately resulted in the CIA truthfully reporting to the FBI that there were no national security issues. Nixon urged the FBI to press forward with the investigation when they expressed concern about interference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4320&amp;st=&amp;st1= Statement Announcing Availability of Additional Transcripts of Presidential Tape Recordings] August 5, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the release of this tape, Nixon had denied any involvement in the scandal. He claimed that there were no political motivations in his instructions to the CIA, and claimed he had no knowledge before March 21, 1973, of involvement by senior campaign officials such as [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]]. The contents of this tape persuaded Nixon's own lawyers, [[Fred Buzhardt]] and [[James D. St. Clair|James St. Clair]], that "the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers—for more than two years".&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein and Woodward (1976): ''The Final Days'', p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; The tape, which [[Barber Conable]] referred to as a "[[Nixon White House tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|smoking gun]]", proved that Nixon had been involved in the cover-up from the beginning.

In the week before Nixon's resignation, Ehrlichman and Haldeman tried unsuccessfully to get Nixon to grant them pardons—which he had promised them before their April 1973 resignations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908732-8,00.html |title=The Administration: The Fallout from Ford's Rush to Pardon|work=Time |date=September 23, 1974 |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the [[Nixon White House tapes#The "smoking gun" tape|"smoking gun" tape]] destroyed Nixon politically. The ten congressmen who had voted against all three articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee announced they would all support the impeachment article accusing Nixon of obstructing justice when the articles came up before the full House.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;Katharine Graham, ''Personal History'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997), p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Rhodes, the House leader of Nixon's party, announced that he would vote to impeach, stating that "coverup of criminal activity and misuse of federal agencies can neither be condoned nor tolerated".&lt;ref name=RhodesObit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/john-j-rhodes-dies-led-gop-in-house-during-watergate/2012/06/05/gJQA84nSGV_story.html|title=John J. Rhodes Dies; Led GOP In House During Watergate|author1=Bart Barnes|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of August 7, 1974, Senators [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Hugh Scott]] and Congressman Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain impeachment when the articles came up for vote in the full House; indeed, by one estimate, no more than 75 representatives were willing to oppose impeachment.&lt;ref name=RhodesObit/&gt; Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were enough votes in the Senate to convict him, and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal.

Realizing that he had no chance of staying in office and that [[public opinion]] was not in his favor, Nixon decided to resign.&lt;ref name=schmidt&gt;{{citation|quote=In 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of a scandal when it was obvious that public opinion no longer supported him.|title=American Government and Politics Today, 2013–2014 Edition|authorlink1=Steffen Schmidt|first=Steffen W.|last=Schmidt|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1133602132|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[s:Richard Nixon's resignation speech|nationally televised address]] from the Oval Office on the evening of August 8, 1974, the president said, in part:

{{quote|In all the decisions I have made in my public life, I have always tried to do what was best for the Nation. Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future.

...&amp;nbsp;I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation would require.

...&amp;nbsp;''I have never been a quitter''. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home. Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/links/nixon_speech.html|title=President Nixon's Resignation Speech|accessdate=August 29, 2009|website=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The morning that his resignation took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said farewell to the White House staff in the [[East Room]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5593631|title=Politicians come and go, but rule of law endures|author=Brokaw, Tom|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=August 29, 2009|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A helicopter carried them from the White House to [[Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland|Andrews Air Force Base]] in [[Maryland]]. Nixon later wrote that he thought, "As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found myself thinking not of the past, but of the future. What could I do now?" At Andrews, he and his family boarded Air Force One to [[El Toro Marine Corps Air Station]] in California, and then were transported to his home [[La Casa Pacifica]] in [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]].

With Nixon's resignation, Congress dropped its impeachment proceedings. Criminal prosecution was still a possibility at both the federal and the state level.&lt;ref name=TimeLegal/&gt; Nixon was [[Inauguration of Gerald Ford|succeeded by]] Vice President [[Gerald Ford]] as President, who on September 8, 1974, issued a full and unconditional [[pardon]] of Nixon, immunizing him from prosecution for any crimes he had "committed or may have committed or taken part in" as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/LIBRARY/speeches/740061.htm |title=Gerald Ford's Proclamation Granting a Pardon to Richard Nixon |website=Ford.utexas.edu |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interest of the country. He said that the Nixon family's situation "is an American tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must."&lt;ref name="pardonspeech2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Ford | first = Gerald | date = September 8, 1974 | url = http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/ford.htm| title =Gerald R.

Nixon continued to proclaim his innocence until his death in 1994. In his official response to the pardon, he said that he "was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fulton|first=Mary Lou |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-17/news/ss-339_1_richard-nixon/2 |title=Nixon Library : Nixon Timeline |page =2 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 17, 1990 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have argued that pardoning Nixon contributed to President Ford's loss of the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1976]].&lt;ref name="shanescott"&gt;{{cite news |first= Scott |last= Shane |title= For Ford, Pardon Decision Was Always Clear-Cut|work=The New York Times |page= A1 |date=December 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations of a secret deal made with Ford, promising a pardon in return for Nixon's resignation, led Ford to testify before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] on October 17, 1974.&lt;ref name="Gettlin, Robert; Colodny, Len 1991 420"&gt;{{cite book

In his autobiography ''A Time to Heal'', Ford wrote about a meeting he had with Nixon's Chief of Staff, [[Alexander Haig]]. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon's staff thought were Nixon's only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try to settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon's staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.

{{quote|Haig emphasized that these weren't ''his'' suggestions. He didn't identify the staff members and he made it very clear that he wasn't recommending any one option over another. What he wanted to know was whether or not my overall assessment of the situation agreed with his. [emphasis in original]&amp;nbsp;... Next he asked if I had any suggestions as to courses of actions for the President. I didn't think it would be proper for me to make any recommendations at all, and I told him so.|[[Gerald Ford]], ''A Time to Heal''&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1979), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Aftermath==
===Final legal actions and effect on the law profession===
[[Charles Colson]] pled guilty to charges concerning the [[Daniel Ellsberg#Fielding break-in|Daniel Ellsberg]] case; in exchange, the indictment against him for covering up the activities of the [[Committee to Re-elect the President]] was dropped, as it was against Strachan. The remaining five members of the Watergate Seven indicted in March went on trial in October 1974. On January 1, 1975, all but Parkinson were found guilty. In 1976, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a new trial for Mardian; subsequently, all charges against him were dropped.

Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell exhausted their appeals in 1977. Ehrlichman entered prison in 1976, followed by the other two in 1977. Since Nixon and many senior officials involved in Watergate were lawyers, the scandal severely tarnished the public image of the legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;Anita L. Allen, ''The New Ethics: A Tour of the 21st Century Landscape'' (New York: Miramax Books, 2004), 101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Shaffer &amp; Mary M.

To defuse public demand for direct federal regulation of lawyers (as opposed to leaving it in the hands of state [[bar associations]] or courts), the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) launched two major reforms. First, the ABA decided that its existing [[American Bar Association Model Code of Professional Responsibility|Model Code of Professional Responsibility]] (promulgated 1969) was a failure. In 1983 it replaced it with the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Schneyer, "Professionalism as Politics: The Making of a Modern Legal Ethics Code", in ''Lawyers' Ideals/Lawyers' Practices: Transformations in the American Legal Profession'', eds. Robert L. Nelson, David M. Trubek, &amp; Rayman L. Solomon, 95–143 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992), 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The MRPC have been adopted in part or in whole by 49 states (and is being considered{{when|date=January 2018}} by the last one, California). Its preamble contains an emphatic reminder that the legal profession can remain self-governing only if lawyers behave properly. Second, the ABA promulgated a requirement that law students at ABA-approved [[law school]]s take a course in [[professional responsibility]] (which means they must study the MRPC). The requirement remains in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=American Bar Association|title=ABA Standards and Rules of Procedure for Approval of Law Schools 2015–2016|date=2015|publisher=American Bar Association|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1-63425-352-9|page=16|chapter-url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/misc/legal_education/Standards/2015_2016_aba_standards_for_approval_of_law_schools_final.authcheckdam.pdf|accessdate=December 15, 2016|chapter=Standard 303, Curriculum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24 and 25, 1975, Nixon gave secret testimony to a [[grand jury]]. According to news reports at the time, Nixon answered questions about the {{frac|18|1|2}}-minute tape gap, altering White House tape transcripts turned over to the House Judiciary Committee, using the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire [[Howard Hughes]]. Aided by the [[Public Citizen Litigation Group]], the historian [[Stanley Kutler]], who has written several books about Nixon and Watergate and had successfully sued for the 1996 public release of the [[Nixon White House tapes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/20004|title=Historian's work gives a glimpse of Nixon "unplugged" |date=November 8, 2011|accessdate=September 30, 2014|website=University of Wisconsin-Madison}}&lt;/ref&gt; sued for release of the transcripts of the Nixon grand jury testimony.&lt;ref name=Secret/&gt;

On July 29, 2011, U.S. District Judge [[Royce Lamberth]] granted Kutler's request, saying historical interests trumped privacy, especially considering that Nixon and other key figures were deceased, and most of the surviving figures had testified under oath, have been written about, or were interviewed. The transcripts were not immediately released pending the government's decision on whether to appeal.&lt;ref name=Secret&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/29/us-nixon-watergate-idUSTRE76S4ZH20110729 "Nixon's secret Watergate testimony ordered released"], Reuters, July 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They were released in their entirety on November 10, 2011, although the names of people still alive were redacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nixon's long-secret grand jury testimony released |author=Kim Geiger |date=November 10, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-nixon-testimony-20111110,0,6436502.story |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Texas A&amp;M University–Central Texas]] professor Luke Nichter wrote the chief judge of the federal court in Washington to release hundreds of pages of sealed records of the [[Watergate Seven]].

===Political and cultural reverberations===
According to Thomas J. Johnson, a professor of journalism at [[University of Texas at Austin]], Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] predicted during Nixon's final days that history would remember Nixon as a great president and that Watergate would be relegated to a "minor footnote".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Johnson, ''Watergate and the Resignation of Richard Nixon: Impact of a Constitutional Crisis'', "The Rehabilitation of Richard Nixon", eds. P. Jeffrey and Thomas Maxwell-Long: Washington, D.C., CO. Press, 2004, pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Congress investigated the scope of the president's legal powers, it belatedly found that consecutive presidential administrations had declared the United States to be in a continuous open-ended [[state of emergency]] since 1950. Congress enacted the [[National Emergencies Act]] in 1976 to regulate such declarations. The Watergate scandal left such an impression on the national and international consciousness that many scandals since then have been labeled with the suffix "[[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|-gate]]".
[[File:1976 campaign button f.JPG|thumb|One of a variety of anti-Ford [[Pin-back button|buttons]] generated during the 1976 presidential election: it reads "Gerald&amp;nbsp;... Pardon me!" and depicts a thief cracking a safe labeled "Watergate".]]

Disgust with the revelations about Watergate, the Republican Party, and Nixon strongly affected results of the November 1974 [[United States Senate elections, 1974|Senate]] and [[United States House election, 1974|House elections]], which took place three months after Nixon's resignation. The Democrats gained five seats in the Senate and forty-nine in the House (the newcomers were nicknamed "[[Watergate Babies]]"). Congress passed legislation that changed [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign financing]], to amend the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], as well as to require financial disclosures by key government officials (via the [[Ethics in Government Act]]). Other types of disclosures, such as releasing recent income tax forms, became expected, though not legally required. Presidents since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had recorded many of their conversations but the practice purportedly ended after Watergate.

Ford's pardon of Nixon played a major role in his defeat in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]] against [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref name="shanescott" /&gt;

In 1977, Nixon arranged [[The Nixon Interviews|an interview]] with British journalist [[David Frost]] in the hope of improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,947901-2,00.html|title = The Nation: David Can Be a Goliath|date = May 9, 1977|work = Time|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and was taken aback by Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished.&lt;ref name="NYTimes David Frost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stelter|first1=Brian|title=David Frost, Interviewer Who Got Nixon to Apologize for Watergate, Dies at 74|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/world/europe/david-frost-known-for-nixon-interview-dead-at-74.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=November 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 movie, [[Frost/Nixon (film)|Frost/Nixon]] is a media depiction of this.

In the aftermath of Watergate, "[[follow the money]]" became part of the American lexicon and is widely believed to have been uttered by Mark Felt to Woodward and Bernstein. The phrase was never used in the 1974 book ''[[All the President's Men]]'' and did not become associated with it until the [[All the President's Men (film)|movie of the same name]] was released in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;"Follow The Money: On The Trail Of Watergate Lore", NPR, June 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 movie, ''[[Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House]]'', is about Mark Felt's role in the Watergate scandal and his identity of being Deep Throat.

The parking garage where Woodward and Felt met in Rosslyn still stands. Its significance was noted by Arlington County with a historical marker in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arlnow.com/2011/08/17/historical-marker-installed-outside-deep-throat-garage/|title=Historical Marker Installed Outside 'Deep Throat' Garage|date=August 17, 2011|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=55498|title=Watergate Investigation Historical Marker|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 it was announced that the garage would be demolished as part of construction of an apartment building on the site; the developers announced that the site's significance would be memorialized within the new complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/parking-garage-where-deep-throat-spilled-beans-watergate-being-torn-down-180961733/?q=|title=The Parking Garage Where Deep Throat Spilled the Beans on Watergate Is Being Torn Down|first=Danny|last=Lewis|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/watergate-parking-garage-to-be-torn-down-1402874716|title=Watergate Parking Garage to Be Torn Down|first=Kris|last=Maher|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=January 23, 2018|via=www.wsj.com|newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of the break-in==
Despite the enormous impact of the Watergate scandal, the purpose of the break-in of the DNC offices has never been conclusively established. Records from the ''United States v. Liddy'' trial, made public in 2013, showed that four of the five burglars testified that they were told the campaign operation hoped to find evidence that linked Cuban funding to Democratic campaigns.&lt;ref name=baldwinlist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/16/watergate-records_n_3606339.html|title=Watergate Records Released 40 Years After Being Filed Under Seal|author=Jessica Gresko, Associated Press|work=The Huffington Post|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longtime hypothesis suggests that the target of the break-in was the offices of [[Larry O'Brien]], the DNC Chairman.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Baldwin III's list of targets that was released in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Among those listed were senior DNC official [[R. Spencer Oliver]], Oliver's secretary Ida "Maxine" Wells, co-worker Robert Allen and secretary Barbara Kennedy.&lt;ref name=baldwinlist /&gt;

Based on these revelations, [[Texas A&amp;M]] history professor Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned for the release of the information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/sites/dcd/files/12-mc-74_memorandum_opinion.pdf|title=In Re: Petition of Luke Nitcher|author=Senior Judge Royce Lamberth|website=United States District Court for the District of Columbia|date=June 11, 2013|accessdate=September 9, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195819/http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/sites/dcd/files/12-mc-74_memorandum_opinion.pdf|archivedate=September 10, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, that the purpose of the break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist [[J. Anthony Lukas]] of the ''New York Times'', who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver's office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1968, O'Brien was appointed by Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] to serve as the national director of Humphrey's presidential campaign and, separately, by [[Howard Hughes]] to serve as Hughes' public-policy lobbyist in Washington. O'Brien was elected national chairman of the DNC in 1968 and 1970. In late 1971, the president's brother, [[Donald Nixon]], was collecting intelligence for his brother at the time and asked [[John H. Meier]], an adviser to Howard Hughes, about O'Brien. In 1956, Donald Nixon had borrowed $205,000 from Howard Hughes and had never repaid the loan. The loan's existence surfaced during the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] campaign, embarrassing Richard Nixon and becoming a political liability. According to author Donald M. Bartlett, Richard Nixon would do whatever was necessary to prevent another family embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Bartlett, ''Howard Hughes'', p. 410, W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-393-32602-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1968 to 1970, Hughes withdrew nearly half a million dollars from the Texas National Bank of Commerce for contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, including presidential candidates Humphrey and Nixon. Hughes wanted Donald Nixon and Meier involved but Nixon opposed this.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Higham ''Howard Hughes'', p. 244, Macmillan, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-312-32997-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes that had never been released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, Larry, and Laurence Gonzales (September 1976). "Hughes, Nixon and the C.I.A.: The Watergate Conspiracy Woodward and Bernstein Missed", ''Playboy''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fred Emery, O'Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign was too much of a danger for Nixon to ignore.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Emery ''Watergate'', p. 30, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-684-81323-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James F. Neal]], who prosecuted the Watergate 7, did not believe Nixon had ordered the break-in because of Nixon's surprised reaction when he was told about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917056,00.html |title=The Nation: It Goes Back to the Big Man Time Magazine January 13, 1975 issue |work=Time |date=January 13, 1975 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1973, then-[[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Kakuei Tanaka]] said that the scandal had "no cancelling influence on U.S. leadership in the world".

===Singapore===
Then-[[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] said in August 1973, "As one surprising revelation follows another at the Senate hearings on Watergate, it becomes increasingly clear that the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.), today is in no position to offer the moral or strong political and economic leadership for which its friends and allies are yearning."&lt;ref name=Spartanburg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XoQsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ds0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7342%2C834424 |title=Watergate Comes Out into Open at Foreign Parley |date=August 5, 1973 |page=A8 |work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=November 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Lee said that the scandal may have led the United States to lessen its interests and commitments in world affairs, to weaken its ability to enforce the [[Paris Peace Accords]] on Vietnam, and to not react to violations of the Accords. Lee said further that the United States "makes the future of this peace in [[Indonesia]] an extremely bleak one with grave consequence for the contiguous states". Lee then blamed the scandal for economic inflation in Singapore because the [[Singapore dollar]] was pegged to the [[United States dollar]] at the time, assuming the U.S. dollar was stronger than the British [[pound sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watergate may sap U.S. power |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A5EjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6qEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3593%2C1690124 |work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location=Montreal |date=August 8, 1973 |page=2 |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1973, when Chairman [[Leonid Brezhnev]] arrived in the United States to have a one-week meeting with Nixon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ray |last=Moseley |date=June 16, 1973 |title=Brezhnev to ignore Watergate in talks |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cKJUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r48DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7240%2C4226076 |work=[[Daily Record (Washington)|Daily Record]] |page=1 |location=Ellensburg, Washington |agency=[[United Press International]] |volume=72 |issue=142 |accessdate=November 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brezhnev told the press, "I do not intend to refer to that matter—[the Watergate]. It would be completely indecent for me to refer to it&amp;nbsp;... My attitude toward Mr. Nixon is of very great respect." When one reporter suggested that Nixon and his position with Brezhnev were "weakened" by the scandal, Brezhnev replied, "It does not enter my mind to think whether Mr. Nixon has lost or gained any influence because of the affair." Then he said further that he had respected Nixon because of Nixon's "realistic and constructive approach to [[Soviet Union–United States relations]]&amp;nbsp;... passing from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations between nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XTkoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yigEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7434%2C4352706 |title=Brezhnev to Shun Talk of Watergate |work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=June 15, 1973 |at=Part 1, page 3 |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Talks between Nixon and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Edward Heath]] may have been bugged. Heath did not publicly display his anger, with aides saying that he was unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not have bothered him. However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would be outraged. Even so, Heath was privately outraged over being taped without his prior knowledge.&lt;ref name="Heath's reaction Maine Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gavshon |first=Arthur L.|authorlink=Arthur Gavshon |date=July 18, 1973 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yHsgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sWcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1093%2C2199417 |title=Britain's Leader Shows Restraint Over Bugging |newspaper=The Lewiston Daily Sun |accessdate=November 25, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other international reactions===
Iranian then-Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] told the press in 1973, "I want to say quite emphatically&amp;nbsp;... that everything that would weaken or jeopardize the President's power to make decisions in split seconds would represent grave danger for the whole world."&lt;ref name=Freed1973/&gt; An unnamed Kenyan senior official of [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Kenya)|Foreign Affairs Ministry]] accused Nixon of lacking interest in Africa and its politics and then said, "American President is so enmeshed in domestic problems created by Watergate that foreign policy seems suddenly to have taken a {{sic|back seat}}."&lt;ref name=Freed1973/&gt; Cuban then-leader [[Fidel Castro]] said in his December 1974 interview that, of the crimes committed by the Cuban exiles, like killings, attacks on Cuban ports, and spying, the Watergate burglaries and wiretappings were "probably the least of [them]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HYc1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nesFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4339%2C455617 |title=Fidel says Watergate least of exiles' crimes |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |page=2A |date=December 2, 1974 |agency=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic reactions===
After the [[fall of Saigon]] ended the Vietnam War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in May 1975 that, if the scandal had not caused Nixon to resign, and Congress had not overridden Nixon's veto of the [[War Powers Resolution]], [[North Vietnam]] would not have captured [[South Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The name-calling in the wake of defeat |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=soMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e30FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1077%2C746828 |date=May 6, 1975 |work=[[New Straits Times]] |location=Malaysia |accessdate=November 23, 2014 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kissinger told the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in January 1977 that Nixon's presidential powers weakened during his tenure, (rephrased by the media) "prevent[ing] the United States from exploiting the [scandal]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kFwqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AlcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1509%2C3522410 |title=Scandal Hurt Policy – Kissinger |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |agency=United Press International |date=January 11, 1977 |page=A-4 |accessdate=November 21, 2016 |via=Google News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publisher of ''[[The Sacramento Union]]'', John P. McGoff, said in January 1975 that the media overemphasized the scandal, though he called it "an important issue", overshadowing more serious topics, like a declining economy and an [[1970s energy crisis|energy crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=75Q1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JTIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3236%2C2592713 |title=Publisher criticizes the media |newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel |agency=United Press International |date=January 30, 1975 |accessdate=October 24, 2015 |via=Google News Archive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elliot Lee Richardson''' (July 20, 1920{{spaced ndash}} December 31, 1999) was an American lawyer and public servant who was a member of the cabinet of Presidents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald Ford]]. As [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]], he was a prominent figure in the [[Watergate Scandal]], and [[Saturday Night Massacre|resigned]] rather than obey President Nixon's order to fire special prosecutor [[Archibald Cox]].

Richardson served as [[Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] from 1970 to 1973, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] from January to May 1973, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] from May to October 1973, and [[Secretary of Commerce]] from 1976 to 1977. That makes him one of only two individuals to have held four [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] positions within the [[United States government]] (the other being [[George Shultz]]).

==Early life and military service==
Richardson was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Clara Lee (née Shattuck) and Edward Peirson Richardson,&lt;ref name="EPRPAPERS"&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~med00027 "Richardson, Edward Peirson, 1881–1944.

Richardson attended [[the Park School]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], and [[Milton Academy]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. He then obtained his [[A.B.]] degree in philosophy from [[Harvard College]], where he resided in [[Winthrop House]], graduated [[cum laude]] in 1941, and was an editor of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]''.

In 1942, following America's entry into World War II, Richardson became a [[combat medic]] in the [[U.S. 4th Infantry Division]]. He participated in the June 6, 1944, [[Normandy Invasion]] as a platoon leader, where he crossed a minefield to rescue a fellow officer whose foot was blown off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0720.html | work=The New York Times | title=Elliot Richardson Dies at 79; Stood Up to Nixon and Resigned In 'Saturday Night Massacre' | access-date=February 15, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203123204/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0720.html | archive-date=February 3, 2017 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was among the first troops to come up ''Causeway No. 2'' from [[Utah Beach]], which had been under fire from German artillery at [[Brécourt Manor Assault|Brécourt Manor]]. He was among the many who noticed the guns ceasing their firing after (unbeknownst to him), paratroopers of the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st]] under Lieutenant [[Richard Winters]] had knocked them out. After [[Stephen Ambrose]]'s book ''[[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]]'' was published, Richardson wrote to Winters and thanked him.

He continued on in the war in Europe with the 4th Infantry Division and received the [[Bronze Star Medal]] and [[Purple Heart]] with [[oak leaf cluster]]. He was discharged in 1945 with the rank of first lieutenant.

In 1947, he graduated from [[Harvard Law School]].  While at Harvard he became editor and president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC1631F935A35751C0A966958260|title=First Black Elected to Head Harvard's Law Review|accessdate=March 24, 2008|publisher=NYT|first=Fox|last=Butterfield|date=February 6, 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410210514/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC1631F935A35751C0A966958260|archive-date=April 10, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation from Law School, Richardson clerked for [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] Judge [[Learned Hand]], and then for Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Richardson joined Ropes, Gray, Best, Coolidge &amp; Rugg in Boston following his clerkship, and became partner of Ropes &amp; Gray in 1961 (the same year the firm, which was founded in 1865, became known as Ropes &amp; Gray).  Richardson left the firm to serve as U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts from 1959 to 1961.  After returning to the firm, Richardson left permanently in 1964 after he was elected the [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts]] and [[Attorney General of Massachusetts]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter R|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613085847/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterR.pdf|archive-date=June 13, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson's older son, [[Henry S. Richardson (philosopher)|Henry S. Richardson]], is a professor of philosophy at [[Georgetown University]], where he focuses in moral and political philosophy.

Richardson was also an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] as a member of the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and a 33rd Degree Freemason in the [[Scottish Rite|Scottish Rite Northern Masonic Jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="LOCPAPERS"&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2010/ms010302.pdf "Elliot Richardson Papers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621131852/http://memory.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2010/ms010302.pdf |date=June 21, 2015 }}, Library of Congress.

Richardson had the distinction of serving in three high-level Executive Branch posts in a single year—the tumultuous year of 1973—as the [[Watergate Scandal]] came to dominate the attention of official Washington, and the American public at large. He is also the only person to hold five separate cabinet positions. He served three relatively uneventful years as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for a popular sitting president. In September 1970, Richardson was present at the funeral of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], President of Egypt as part of America's delegation. He secretly met with [[Anwar Sadat]], Nasser's successor to discuss a possible peace process with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=shifoooo|title=Yom Kippur War 1973: The Egyptian Revenge - (1/4)|date=2008-10-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BumWLG_v1b4&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2019-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409000341/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BumWLG_v1b4&amp;feature=youtu.be|archive-date=April 9, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1972, as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Richardson established The National High Blood Pressure Education Program, at the urging of Mary Lasker who came armed with copies of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents, directed by Edward Freis.

Richardson was appointed [[United States Secretary of Defense]] on January 30, 1973.&lt;ref name="Historical Office Elliot L. Richardson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/Article/571290/elliot-l-richardson/|title=Elliot L.

In his confirmation hearing, Richardson expressed agreement with Nixon's policies on such issues as the adequacy of U.S. strategic forces, NATO and relationships with other allies, and Vietnam.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Although he promised to examine the budget carefully to identify areas for savings, and in fact later ordered the closing of some military installations, he cautioned against precipitate cuts. As he told a Senate committee, "Significant cuts in the Defense Budget now would seriously weaken the U.S. position on international negotiations—in which U.S. military capabilities, in both real and symbolic terms, are an important factor." Similarly, he strongly supported continued military assistance at current levels. During his short tenure, Richardson spent much time testifying before congressional committees on the proposed FY 1974 budget and other Defense matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/richardson.htm |title=SecDef Histories – Elliot Richardson |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |publisher=Secretary of Defense |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807210430/http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/richardson.htm |archivedate=August 7, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson would serve as Secretary of Defense for 4 months before becoming Nixon's Attorney General, a move that would put him in the Watergate spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Doyle, James|title=Not Above the Law: the battles of Watergate prosecutors Cox and Jaworski|publisher=William Morrow and Company|location=New York|year=1977|isbn=0-688-03192-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/notabovelawbattl00doyl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1973, after Richardson had served 5 months as Attorney General, President Nixon ordered him to fire the top lawyer investigating the Watergate scandal, Special Prosecutor [[Archibald Cox]]. Richardson had promised Congress he would not interfere with the Special Prosecutor, and, rather than disobey the President or break his promise, he resigned. President Nixon subsequently ordered Richardson's second-in-command, Deputy Attorney General [[William Ruckelshaus]], to carry out the order. He too had promised not to interfere, and also tendered his resignation. The third in command, [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] [[Robert Bork]], planned to resign after firing Cox, but Richardson persuaded him not to in order to ensure proper leadership at the Department of Justice during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Interview with Deputy Assistant Attorney General John C.

[[Patrick Buchanan|Pat Buchanan]] reports on Richardson's dismissal that Nixon said in the Oval Office on the day of the Saturday Night Massacre, "I don't have any choice, I can't have President Brezhnev watch me be bullied by a member of my cabinet, I've got to fire him." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/pat_buchanan_on_nixontrump_comparison_history_repeats_itself_first_as_tragedy_then_as_farce.html|accessdate=June 22, 2017|title=Pat Buchanan on Nixon/Trump Comparison: History Repeats Itself, First As Tragedy, Then As Farce|publisher=RealClearPolitics.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306023411/https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/pat_buchanan_on_nixontrump_comparison_history_repeats_itself_first_as_tragedy_then_as_farce.html|archive-date=March 6, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the resignation of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], Richardson was portrayed as a cartoon figure with Agnew and Nixon on the cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' dated October 8, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19731008,00.html|title=Time Magazine Cover: Spiro Agnew|date=October 8, 1973|accessdate=December 30, 2007|work=TIME.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227181734/http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19731008,00.html|archive-date=December 27, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew was quoted as saying: "I am innocent of the charges against me. I will not resign if indicted!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Agnew Takes on the Justice Department|date=October 8, 1973|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907981,00.html|work=TIME|accessdate=December 30, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214080704/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907981,00.html|archive-date=December 14, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew later claimed the prosecution which eventually drove him from office was pushed by Richardson for the specific reason that Richardson wished to be nominated as the next Vice President, which would either give him the inside track for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, or, should Nixon resign over Watergate, elevate Richardson to the presidency. Richardson denied both then and later taking any extraordinary steps in the investigation of Agnew, instead leaving the task up to the [[United States Attorney for the District of Maryland]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1974, Richardson received the [[John Heinz]] Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|title=National - Jefferson Awards Foundation|publisher=|access-date=August 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043935/http://jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|archive-date=November 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gerald Ford]] administration, Richardson served as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] from 1975–76 and as [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] from 1976–77.

Richardson's acceptance in 1975 of the appointment as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the Court of St. James's]], as it is formally titled, effectively eliminated him from the domestic scene during the pre-election-year period. In departing for that position, he indicated to reporters that he would not run unless Ford decided against running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Elliot_L._Richardson.aspx|title=Elliot Lee Richardson|publisher=The Encyclopedia.com|work=2005 West's Encyclopedia of American Law|access-date=March 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205114203/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Elliot_L._Richardson.aspx|archive-date=February 5, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1977 to 1980, he served as an Ambassador at Large and Special Representative of President [[Jimmy Carter]] for the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and head of the U.S. delegation to the Third [[United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richardson, Elliot L.|title=Power, Mobility and the Law of the Sea|date=Spring 1980|work=Foreign Affairs|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800301faessay8260/elliot-l-richardson/power-mobility-and-the-law-of-the-sea.html|accessdate=April 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006121254/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19800301faessay8260/elliot-l-richardson/power-mobility-and-the-law-of-the-sea.html|archive-date=October 6, 2008|url-status=dead}} (Article Preview).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1974 Richardson gave the commencement address at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and received an honorary Doctors of Law. In 1980, Richardson received an [[L.H.D.|honorary degree]] from [[Bates College]]. In 1983, Richardson was admitted as an honorary member of the Massachusetts [[Society of the Cincinnati]]. In 1984, he ran for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by [[Paul Tsongas]]. Although Richardson was favored to win the seat, he was defeated in the GOP primary by more conservative candidate [[Ray Shamie]],&lt;ref&gt;Kornacki, Steve (January 5, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/01/05/tea_party_gop_targets/index.html The Republicans who should fear the Tea Party the most] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107072747/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/01/05/tea_party_gop_targets/index.html |date=January 7, 2011 }}, ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who lost the general election to [[John F. Kerry]].

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Richardson was associated with the Washington, D.C., office of the New York City law firm of [[Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy]], of which [[John J. McCloy]] was a founding partner. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Richardson was the attorney for [[Inslaw|Inslaw, Inc.]], an American software company which alleged that its software had been pirated by the [[U.S. Justice Department]].
In 1994, Richardson backed President [[Bill Clinton]] during his struggle against [[Paula Jones]]'s charge of sexual harassment. In 1998, he received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the nation's highest civilian honor.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Death==
On [[New Year's Eve]], 1999, Richardson died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 79. Major media outlets, such as [[CNN]], recognized him as the "Watergate martyr" for refusing an order from President Nixon to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

A recent widower, as his wife, Anne, had just died earlier that year, he was survived by three children, a sister and a brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elliot Richardson dies|publisher=nytimes.com|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0720.html|date=January 1, 2000|accessdate=August 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723170941/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0720.html|archive-date=July 23, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
Richardson was the author of two books.  ''The Creative Balance: Government, Politics, and the Individual in America's Third Century'' was published by [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] in 1976.  ''Reflections of a Radical Moderate'' was published by [[Westview Press]] in 1996. ''Reflections'' expresses his outlook:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a moderate – a radical moderate. I believe profoundly in the ultimate value of human dignity and equality. I therefore believe as well in such essential contributions to these ends as fairness, tolerance, and mutual respect. In seeking to be fair, tolerant, and respectful I need to call upon all the empathy, understanding, rationality, skepticism, balance, and objectivity I can muster.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Elliot (1996). ''Reflections of a Radical Moderate'' (preface). Pantheon Books; {{ISBN|978-0-679-42820-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Popular Culture ==
An image of Richardson taken by photographer [[Garry Winogrand]] features in the cover art of rock band [[Interpol (band)|Interpol's]] 2018 album [[Marauder (Interpol album)|''Marauder'']]. Singer and guitarist [[Paul Banks (musician, born 1978)|Paul Banks]] referred&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interpol-interview-marauder-album-release-date-paul-banks-daniel-kessler-sam-fogarino-a8440101.html|title=Interpol explore the inner Marauder on their upcoming album â€“ interview|date=2018-07-10|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120103524/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interpol-interview-marauder-album-release-date-paul-banks-daniel-kessler-sam-fogarino-a8440101.html|archive-date=January 20, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; to him as a hero, who "refused to be bullied into going against his personal principles".

A less flattering portrait of Richardson can be found in Thomas Mallon’s novel Watergate, where he is shown to be an ambitious but ineffective Machiavellian schemer.

The '''[[Watergate Scandal]]''' refers to the burglary and illegal wiretapping of the [[Washington, D.C.]] headquarters of the [[Democratic National Committee]], in the [[Watergate complex]], by members of [[President of the United States]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s re-election committee and subsequent abuse of powers by the president and administration officials to halt or hinder the investigation into same.

==1960s==
* November 5, 1968: Richard Nixon [[United States presidential election of 1968|elected President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showelection.php?year=1968 | title =The American Presidency Project Election of 1968 | author =Gerhard Peters | publisher =ucsb.edu | url-status =live | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160928030722/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showelection.php?year=1968 | archivedate =2016-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 20, 1969: Richard Nixon is inaugurated as the 37th President of The United States.

==1970s==
* July 1, 1971: [[David Young (Watergate)|David Young]] and [[Egil Krogh|Egil "Bud" Krogh]] write a memo suggesting the formation of what later became called the "[[White House Plumbers]]" in response to the leak of the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' by [[Daniel Ellsberg]].
* August 21, 1971: [[Nixon's Enemies List]] is started by White House aides (though Nixon himself may not have been aware of it); to "use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies."
* September 3, 1971: "White House Plumbers" [[E. Howard Hunt]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], and others break into the offices of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist Lewis Fielding looking for material that might discredit Ellsberg, under the direction of [[John Ehrlichman]] or his staff within the White House. This was the Plumbers' first major operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/The-Worlds-Most-Famous-Filing-Cabinet-169793406.html | title =The World's Most Famous Filing Cabinet: After Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers, the infamous Plumbers broke into his psychiatrist's office, looking for a way to discredit him | author =Owen Edwards | author2 =''[[Smithsonian Magazine]]'' | publisher =smithsonianmag.com | date =October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* By early 1972, the Plumbers, at this stage assigned to the [[Committee to Re-Elect the President]] (CRP), had become frustrated at the lack of additional assignments they were being asked to perform, and that any plans and proposals they suggested were being rejected by CRP. Liddy and Hunt took their complaints to the White House – most likely to [[Charles Colson]] – and requested that the White House start putting pressure on CRP to assign them new operations. It is likely that both Colson and White House Chief of Staff [[H.R. Haldeman]] did so, starting the train of events that led to the Watergate break-ins a few months later. This narrative was confirmed in the famous "[[Cancer on the Presidency]]" conversation between Nixon and White House Counsel [[John Dean]] on March 21, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/watergate/trial/exhibit_12.pdf | title =Transcript of a recording of a meeting among the President, John Dean, and H.R.

* May 2, 1972: [[J. Edgar Hoover]] dies; [[L. Patrick Gray]] is appointed acting [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI director]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS20963.pdf | title =Nomination and Confirmation of the FBI Director: Process and Recent History | author =Henry B.

* June 17, 1972: The plumbers are arrested at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. in the process of burglarizing and planting [[Covert listening device|surveillance bugs]] in the [[Democratic National Committee]] offices at the [[Watergate complex|Watergate Building Complex]].
* June 20, 1972: Reportedly based on a tip from [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] (associate director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Mark Felt]]), [[Bob Woodward]] reports in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that one of the burglars had [[E. Howard Hunt]] in his address book and possessed checks signed by Hunt, and that Hunt was connected to  Charles Colson.
* June 23, 1972: In the [[Oval Office]], H.R. Haldeman recommends to President Nixon that they attempt to shut down the FBI investigation of the Watergate break-in, by having CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] and Deputy Director [[Vernon A. Walters]] tell acting FBI Director [[L. Patrick Gray]] to, "Stay the hell out of this". Haldeman expects Gray will then seek and take advice from Deputy FBI Director [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Mark Felt]], and Felt will obey direction from the White House out of ambition. Nixon agrees and gives the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part3.html|title=The Watergate Story {{!}} Nixon Resigns|website=The Washington Post|access-date=2016-12-30|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125171439/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part3.html|archivedate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nixon White House tapes#The .22smoking gun.22 tape|The conversation is recorded.]]
* September 15, 1972: Hunt, Liddy, and the Watergate burglars are indicted by a federal grand jury.
* November 7, 1972: [[1972 United States presidential election|Nixon re-elected]], defeating [[George McGovern]] with the largest plurality of votes in American history.

* January 20, 1973: Nixon is inaugurated for his second term.
* February 28, 1973: Confirmation hearings begin for confirming [[L. Patrick Gray]] as permanent Director of the FBI. During these hearings, Gray reveals that he had complied with an order from John Dean to provide daily updates on the Watergate investigation, and also that Dean had "probably lied" to FBI investigators.
* March 17, 1973: Watergate burglar McCord writes a letter to Judge [[John Sirica]], claiming that some of his testimony was perjured under pressure and that the burglary was not a CIA operation, but had involved other government officials, thereby leading the investigation to the White House.

'''Bruce Givner''' (born November 16, 1950) is an American attorney best known for his role on the evening of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate burglary]]. While working as an intern, Givner remained in the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s Watergate offices until just after midnight, making free long-distance phone calls to friends and family. His presence substantially delayed the break-in and indirectly led to the eventual arrests of the burglars.&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/trump-s-legal-travails-stir-revival-in-unresolved-puzzles-of-watergate-20190614-p51xvo.html |title=Trump's legal travails stir revival in unresolved puzzles of Watergate |first=Peter |last=Hannam |date=June 23, 2019 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=October 13, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Givner was born and raised in [[Lorain, Ohio]]. Givner's father, Eugene, was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] when Givner was eight years old. Givner's father was forced out of the family business—Givner's Luggage and Jewelry, a general store of sorts in Lorain that sold luggage, jewelry, and the engraving of it, as well as men's clothing. Due to his illness, Eugene Givner was restricted to a wheelchair and was told he would have to move his family to a less humid climate. The family chose to move to [[Encino, California]], after finding a wheelchair-friendly home in that town. Givner's mother, Sonia Ann ("Sunny") worked as a [[realtor]] (and sometimes in the Givner store's jewelry department).

== Education ==
Givner attended the following schools:
* Washington Elementary School (1956 to 1963)
* Hawthorne Junior High (1963 to 1964)  
* [[Lorain Admiral King High School]], Lorain, Ohio (1965 to 1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Chronicle Telegram |date=August 5, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805075601/http://www.chroniclet.com/Local-News/2019/08/05/Former-Lorain-resident-had-a-small-role-in-Watergate.html |archivedate=August 5, 2019 |url=http://www.chroniclet.com/Local-News/2019/08/05/Former-Lorain-resident-had-a-small-role-in-Watergate.html |title=Former Lorain resident had a small role in Watergate |first=Christina |last=Jolliffe |accessdate=October 13, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after Givner graduated from Admiral King High School in Ohio, he flew to [[Los Angeles]] and moved into [[Sproul Hall]] at [[UCLA]]. By the end of 1971, his sophomore year, he became involved in student government. The faculty assigned him to a group that [[Rick Tuttle]] was in, an original freedom rider with [[Martin Luther King]], who later became treasurer of the city of L.A. [[Sheila Kuehl]], an L.A. County Commissioner, was also a part of that group. At the end of his junior year at UCLA, Givner entered the Summer Internship Program which placed students in various government offices in Los Angeles, [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=mercury&gt;{{cite news |date=June 18, 2019 |title=How the Watergate Break-In Was Messed Up By a Then UCLA Student |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2019/06/14/the-man-who-stayed-late-the-watergate-story-youve-never-heard/ |first=Keith |last=Sharon |accessdate=October 13, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Givner landed an internship at the [[Democratic National Committee]], not the most coveted position; those who were lucky were given ones with members of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. 

== Watergate ==
Givner played a role in the FBI's investigation of the [[Watergate scandal]]. He was featured in Joseph Rodota's book ''The Watergate: Inside America's Most Infamous Address.'' Givner is also cited in many articles such as ''[[Harper's]]'' January 1980 feature story: "The McCord File" by Jim Hougan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hougan|first1=Jim|title=The McCord File|journal=Harper's Magazine|url=https://harpers.org/archive/1980/01/the-mccord-file/|date=January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was the only subject in ''Columbia Law School News' '' "If Not for Him, Nixon Might Still Be President" by Jim Shaw, referring to Givner as the person "if not for…". He also has been written about in a book by [[Roger Stone]] and Mike Colapietro titled ''Nixon's Secrets: The Rise, Fall, and Untold Truth about the President, Watergate, and the Pardon'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stone |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Stone |date=11 August 2014 |title=Nixon's Secrets: The Rise, Fall, and Untold Truth about the President, Watergate, and the Pardon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPMiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA435 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |isbn=9781629146034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''White House Call Girl: The Real Story'' written by [[Phil Stanford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stanford |first1=Phil |title=White House Call Girl: The Real Watergate Story |date=September 2, 2013 |publisher=Feral House |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=cduVngEACAAJ |isbn=9781936239900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Givner was a 21-year-old intern working at the DNC offices on the sixth floor of the [[Watergate complex|Watergate office complex]] when his prolonged stay on that floor the night of June 16, 1972, precluded the group of "bandits" from entering the building to correct their earlier [[wiretap]] work.&lt;ref name=mercury /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=5–6 |isbn=9780062476623 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yokDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT11 |title=The Watergate: Inside America's Most Infamous Address |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |last1=Rodota |first1=Joseph |date=2018-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminals were set up across the street in a suite above the [[Howard Johnson's]], while they waited for the lights to go out in the offices on the sixth floor at the DNC offices. Though Givner finished his intern duties around 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., he stayed to use a [[WATS line]] to make "about 20"&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; free long-distance calls to friends and family, both in Los Angeles and Ohio.&lt;ref name=mercury/&gt; Sometime during the middle of those calls, Givner needed to use the restroom. Realizing he could not re-enter the suites when using the bathroom in the hallway because he had no key to re-enter, Givner stepped out onto the balcony and relieved himself in a cement planter. (The Watergate burglars likely witnessed that event through binoculars as they lay in wait for the right time to make their move, which they finally did less than an hour after Givner left the building shortly after midnight.) That was long after the burglars had hoped to get in.

After his phone calls that evening, Givner finally turned off the lights on Saturday, June 17, 1972, at 12:05 a.m., he told numerous reporters over the years. He then bolted down the stairwell, where he began chatting in the lobby with [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]], the security guard on duty at midnight at the Watergate.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/watergate/watergate-part-87-of/view#document/p61 |title=Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts Subject:WATERGATE |work=Federal Bureau of Investigation |date=6 June 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After some friendly small talk, Wills and Givner headed across the street to the Howard Johnson's restaurant for cheeseburgers, fries, and milkshakes. Wills began to follow up with his supervisor's supervisor (he couldn't reach his own)—the person to whom he reported the tape on the level two basement door before he left for the Howard Johnson's. The tape was still there which prevented the door from locking. Shortly after reconnecting with his supervisor's supervisor, Wills called police, who arrived within minutes. The burglars had sneaked in, and arrests were quickly made.

When Givner returned to his office at the DNC the following day{{snd}}Saturday afternoon, around 3 p.m.{{snd}}the sixth floor was swarming with police, FBI and other authorities. Givner let them know he had not left the building until shortly after midnight. That critical piece of information was pivotal to the investigation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On November 10, 1974, ''[[The New York Times Sunday Magazine]]'' published an article by [[Sol Stern]] about the Watergate break-in, "A Watergate Footnote,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Sol|title=A Watergate Footnote|journal=The New York Times|date=November 10, 1974|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/10/archives/a-watergate-footnote-the-selling-of-frank-wills-frank-wills-after-a.html |accessdate=October 13, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein Stern refers to Givner as "the mystery man" in the Watergate event. Givner wrote to the ''Times'' explaining who he was and downplaying any participation in the critical and historical event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stern |first=Sol |date=1 December 1974 |title=Letters |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/01/archives/letters-unto-the-nth-generation-doubly-victimized-compensatory.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |quote=I have now been contacted by the so‐called mystery man and he turns out to be not very mysterious. He is Bruce Givner, 24, a second‐year law student at Columbia University. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' published his letter. Givner also was interviewed by Bob Fink, a researcher for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who had been hired by [[Woodward and Bernstein]] to work on their book, ''[[All the President's Men]]''. Fink confronted Givner, at first, strongly suggesting that Givner may have been a part of the botched event, a plant, but shortly after that conversation, Fink was convinced Givner had not played a role in the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=9781476770512 |title=All the President's Men |last1=Bernstein |first1=Carl |last2=Woodward |first2=Bob |date=2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wills was lauded as the hero who alerted police of the break-in, though later, Givner was credited as having provided critical information. Givner was not only questioned by the D.C. police and the FBI, but in October 1973 he also was interviewed by Senator [[Fred Thompson]], who was the minority counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities. Givner was credited with having stopped the [[James W. McCord Jr.|McCord]] group from getting into the building to do their dirty work "on time".

In 2019, Givner released a book titled ''My Watergate Scandal Tell-All: How I Unwittingly Caused This Historic Event'' (www.mywatergatescandal.com) recalling and detailing his experiences and life before and during the Watergate events. He held a press conference at the former DNC headquarters (now SAGE publishing) along with Watergate arresting officers, Paul Leeper and John Barrett. The three took media on a tour of the 6th floor of the Watergate describing each moment of Givner's late stay there and the officers' blow-by-blow description of the arrest.

== Career ==
Givner was admitted to the [[State Bar of California]] in December 1976 and began practicing law in Encino. Givner currently practices tax law in [[Los Angeles]] at the law offices of [https://kfblawgroup.com/ KFBLawgroup].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kfblawgroup.com/|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://people.com/movies/brad-angelina-kids-lifestyle-cost/ |title=Inside Brad and Angelina's Divorce: How Much Does Their Kids' Lifestyle Cost? |first=Dana Rose |last=Falcone |date=August 15, 2018 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=October 13, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nixon series}}
The '''Nixon White House tapes''' are audio recordings of conversations between [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] and Nixon administration officials, Nixon family members, and [[White House]] staff, produced between 1971 and 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/virtuallibrary/tapeexcerpts/|title=Nixon White House Tapes – Online|website=www.nixonlibrary.gov|access-date=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215222555/https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/virtuallibrary/tapeexcerpts/#|archive-date=December 15, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1971, a sound-activated taping system was installed in the [[Oval Office]], including in Nixon's [[Wilson desk|Oval Office desk]], using [[Sony]] TC-800B open-reel tape recorders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pimall.com/nais/pivintage/nixonrecorders.html|title=Nixon White House Tape Recorders|website=www.pimall.com|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to capture audio transmitted by [[Telephone tapping|telephone taps]] and concealed microphones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1988/summer/haldeman.html|title=The Nixon White House Tapes|date=August 15, 2016|newspaper=National Archives|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was expanded to include other rooms within the White House and [[Camp David]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The system was turned off on July 18, 1973, two days after it became public knowledge as a result of the [[Senate Watergate Committee]] hearings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Nixon was not the first president to record his White House conversations; President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] recorded Oval Office press conferences for a short period in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/14/nyregion/secret-oval-office-recordings-by-rooseve-lt-in-40-disclosed.html|title=Secret Oval Office Recordings by Roosevelt in '40 Disclosed|last=Bennetts|first=Leslie|date=January 14, 1982|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tapes' existence came to light during the [[Watergate scandal]] of 1973 and 1974, when the system was mentioned during the televised testimony of White House aide [[Alexander Butterfield]] before the [[United States Senate Watergate Committee|Senate Watergate Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/071773-1.htm|title=WashingtonPost.com: President Taped Talks, Phone Calls; Lawyer Ties Ehrlichman to Payments|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon's refusal of a congressional subpoena to release the tapes constituted an [[Articles of impeachment|article of impeachment]] against Nixon, and led to his subsequent resignation on August 9, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/rnimparticles.htm|title=Nixon impeachment articles|website=academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tape recorder from President Nixon's Oval Office.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Oval Office]] tape recorder]]
Just prior to assuming office in January 1969, President Nixon learned that his predecessor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]], had installed a system to record his meetings and telephone calls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to his [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] [[H. R. Haldeman]], Nixon ordered the system removed, but during the first two years of his presidency he came to the conclusion (after trying other means) that audio recordings were the only way to ensure a full and faithful account of conversations and decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At Nixon's request, Haldeman and his staff—including Deputy Assistant Alexander Butterfield—worked with the [[United States Secret Service]] to install a recording system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On February 16, 1971, a taping system was installed in two rooms in the White House, namely, the Oval Office and the [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Three months later, microphones were added to President Nixon's private office in the [[Old Executive Office Building]] and the following year microphones were installed in the presidential lodge at Camp David.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nixon.archives.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/learn/history.php|title=History of the White House Tapes|accessdate=February 14, 2012|publisher=Richard Nixon Presidential Library|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015061225/http://nixon.archives.gov/forresearchers/find/tapes/learn/history.php#|archive-date=October 15, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was installed and monitored by the Secret Service, and the tapes were stored in a room in the White House basement.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Significant phone lines were tapped as well, including those in the Oval Office, Old Executive Office Building and the [[Lincoln Sitting Room]], which was Nixon's favorite room in the White House. Telephone conversations were recorded by tapping the telephone lines from the White House switchboard and relaying the conversations to recorders in a closet in the basement of the residence.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; All audio equipment was sound-activated, except in the Cabinet Room.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All locations in the White House were activated by the [[United States Secret Service|Executive Protective Service]]'s "First Family Locator" system: when an officer notified the system that the president was in the Oval Office, the taping machinery switched on, ready to record when triggered by sound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nixon Tapes: Secret Recordings from the White House|publisher=The National Security Archive|authors=Kate Doyle, Ron Sodano, Sam Rushay|date=August 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By design, only very few individuals (apart from Nixon and Haldeman) knew of the existence of the taping system: Butterfield, Haldeman's assistant [[Lawrence Higby]], and the Secret Service technicians who had installed it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The recordings were produced on as many as nine Sony TC-800B machines using very thin 0.5mil tape at the slow speed of 15/16 inches (23&amp;nbsp;mm) per second.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The tapes contain more than 3,000 hours of conversation.&lt;ref name="content"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-04-26/news/9404260236_1_watergate-office-building-scholars-or-journalists-national-archives|title=Nixon Lawyer Balks At Releasing Tapes|accessdate=February 14, 2012|date=April 26, 1994|work=The New York Times|publisher=The Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of hours are of discussions on foreign policy, including planning for the [[1972 Nixon visit to China]] and subsequent visit to the Soviet Union.

== Revelation of the taping system ==
{{Watergate|Events}}
The existence of the White House taping system was first confirmed by Senate Committee staff member [[Donald Sanders]], on July 13, 1973, in an interview with White House aide Alexander Butterfield. Three days later, it was made public during the televised testimony of Butterfield, when he was asked about the possibility of a White House taping system by Senate Counsel [[Fred Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-man-who-revealed-the-nixon-tapes/2012/06/14/gJQAsEZUdV_story.html | title=The man who revealed the Nixon tapes | first=Alicia | last=Shepard | date=June 14, 2012 | work=Washington Post | accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 1973, Butterfield told the committee in a televised hearing that Nixon had ordered a taping system installed in the White House to automatically record all conversations. Special Counsel [[Archibald Cox]], a former [[United States Solicitor General]] under President John F. Kennedy, asked District Court Judge [[John Sirica]] to [[subpoena]] nine relevant tapes to confirm the testimony of [[White House Counsel]] [[John Dean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/072773-1.htm|title=WashingtonPost.com: Court Battle Set as Nixon Defies Subpoenas|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saturday Night Massacre ===
{{Main|Saturday Night Massacre}}
President Nixon initially refused to release the tapes, for two reasons: first, that the [[Constitution]]al principle of [[executive privilege]] extends to the tapes and citing the [[separation of powers]] and [[checks and balances]] within the Constitution, and second, claiming they were vital to national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/072473-1.htm|title=President Refuses to Turn Over Tapes; Ervin Committee, Cox Issue Subpoenas|work=Washington Post|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, 1973, he offered a [[Stennis Compromise|compromise]]; Nixon proposed that U.S. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John C. Stennis]] review and summarize the tapes for accuracy and report his findings to the special prosecutor's office.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/watergate-constitution/chronology.html|title=Watergate and the Constitution|date=August 15, 2016|newspaper=National Archives|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special prosecutor [[Archibald Cox]] refused the compromise and on Saturday, October 20, 1973, Nixon ordered Attorney General [[Elliot Richardson]] to fire Cox.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Richardson refused and resigned instead, then [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[William Ruckelshaus]] was asked to fire Cox but refused and was subsequently fired. [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] and acting head of the Justice Department [[Robert Bork]] fired Cox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/102173-2.htm|title=WashingtonPost.com: Nixon Forces Firing of Cox; Richardson, Ruckelshaus Quit|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon appointed [[Leon Jaworski]] special counsel on November 1, 1973.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== The 18½-minute gap ===
&lt;!-- DO NOT change this subsection heading—"The 18½-minute gap"—as multiple redirects are anchored to it. Thank you. --&gt;
According to President Nixon's secretary, [[Rose Mary Woods]], on '''September 29, 1973''', she was reviewing a tape of the June 20, 1972, recordings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watergate.info/burglary/burglars.shtml |title=Watergate Burglars |publisher=Watergate.info |date=June 17, 1972 |accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she made "a terrible mistake" during transcription. While playing the tape on a [[Uher (brand)|Uher 5000]], she answered a phone call. Reaching for the Uher 5000 stop button, she said that she mistakenly hit the button next to it, the record button. For the duration of the phone call, about 5 minutes, she kept her foot on the device's pedal, causing a five-minute portion of the tape to be rerecorded. When she listened to the tape, the gap had grown to {{frac|18|1|2}} minutes. She later insisted that she was not responsible for the remaining 13 minutes of buzz.{{cn|date=July 2019}}

The contents missing from the recording remain unknown, though the gap occurs during a conversation between Nixon and H. R. Haldeman, three days after the Watergate break in.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nixon claimed not to know the topic or topics discussed during the gap.&lt;ref name=Pelofsky/&gt; Haldeman's notes from the meeting show that among the topics of discussion were the arrests at the Watergate Hotel. White House lawyers first heard of the gap on the evening of November 14, 1973, and Judge Sirica, who had issued the subpoenas for the tapes, was not told until November 21, after the President's attorneys had decided that there was "no innocent explanation" they could offer.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/120773-1.htm | title=Haig Tells of Theories on Erasure | work=The Washington Post | date=December 7, 1973 | accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rose Mary Woods.jpg|thumb|right|Rose Mary Woods attempting to demonstrate how she may have inadvertently created the gap]]
Woods was asked to replicate the position she took to cause that accident. Seated at a desk, she reached far back over her left shoulder for a telephone as her foot applied pressure to the pedal controlling the transcription machine. Her posture during the demonstration, dubbed the "Rose Mary Stretch", resulted in many political commentators questioning the validity of the explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30678-2005Jan23.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Rose Mary Woods Dies; Loyal Nixon Secretary | first=Patricia | last=Sullivan | date=January 24, 2005 | accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a grand jury interview in 1975, Nixon said that he initially believed that only four minutes of the tape were missing. He said that when he later heard that 18 minutes were missing, "I practically blew my stack."&lt;ref name=Pelofsky&gt;{{cite news |title=Nixon nearly "blew my stack" over Watergate tape gap |author1=Jeremy Pelofsky |author2=James Vicini |date=November 10, 2011 |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/10/us-usa-nixon-tapes-idUSTRE7A96DR20111110 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nixon's counsel, John Dean, in his 2014 book ''The Nixon Defense,'' suggests that the full collection of recordings now available "largely answer the questions regarding what was known by the White House about the reasons for the break-in and bugging at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, as well as what was erased during the infamous 18 minute and 30 second gap during the June 20, 1972, conversation and why."&lt;ref name="justia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://verdict.justia.com/2014/08/10/thoughts-nixons-resignation | accessdate=April 7, 2015|title=Thoughts on Nixon's resignation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of suggestions have been made as to who could have erased the tape. Years later, former [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Alexander Haig]] speculated that the erasures may conceivably have been caused by Nixon himself. According to Haig, the President was "spectacularly inept" at understanding and operating mechanical devices, and in the course of reviewing the tape in question, he may have caused the erasures by fumbling with the recorder's controls; whether inadvertently or intentionally, Haig could not say. In 1973, Haig had speculated aloud that the erasure was caused by an unidentified "sinister force".&lt;ref&gt;Slansky, Paul. "Idiots, Hypocrites, Demagogues, and More Idiots: Not-So-Great Moments in Modern American Politics." Bloomsbury Publishing 2007.12.26 p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Others have suggested that Haig was involved in deliberately erasing the tapes with Nixon's involvement, or that the erasure was conducted by a White House lawyer.&lt;ref name="Truth in a Lie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robenalt|first1=James|title=Truth in a Lie: Forty Years After the 18½ Minute Gap|url=http://www.washingtondecoded.com/site/2014/05/robenalt.html|website=Washington Decoded|accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cracking Watergate's Infamous 18 1/2 Minute Gap"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mellinger|first1=Phil|title=Cracking Watergate's Infamous 18 1/2 Minute Gap|url=http://www.forensicmag.com/articles/2011/02/cracking-watergates-infamous-18-1-2-minute-gap|website=Forensics Magazine|accessdate=December 1, 2015|date=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Investigations ====
Nixon himself launched the first investigation into how the tapes were erased. He claimed that it was an intensive investigation but came up empty.&lt;ref name=Pelofsky /&gt;

On November 21, 1973, Sirica appointed a panel of persons nominated jointly by the White House and the Special Prosecution Force. The panel was supplied with the Evidence Tape, the seven tape recorders from the Oval Office and Executive Office Building, and the two Uher 5000 recorders. One Uher 5000 was marked "Secret Service". The other was accompanied by a foot pedal, respectively labeled Government Exhibit 60 and 60B. The panel determined that the buzz was of no consequence, and that the gap was due to erasure&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Panel on White House Tapes (1974) page 4&lt;/ref&gt; performed on the Exhibit 60 Uher.&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Panel on White House Tapes (1974) page 11&lt;/ref&gt; The panel also determined that the erasure/buzz recording consisted of at least five separate segments, possibly as many as nine,&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Panel on White House Tapes (1974) page 36&lt;/ref&gt; and that at least five segments required hand operation; that is, they could not have been performed using the foot pedal.&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Panel on White House Tapes (1974) page 44&lt;/ref&gt; The panel was subsequently asked by the court to consider alternative explanations that had emerged during the hearings. The final report, dated May 31, 1974, found these other explanations did not contradict the original findings.&lt;ref&gt;Advisory Panel on White House Tapes (1974) page iv&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] now owns the tape, and has tried several times to recover the missing minutes—most recently in 2003—but without success.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-tape-gap-still-a-mystery/|title=Watergate Tape Gap Still A Mystery|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tapes are now preserved in a climate-controlled vault in case a future technological development allows for restoration of the missing audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/09/us/national-archives-has-given-up-on-filling-the-nixon-tape-gap.html|title=National Archives Has Given Up On Filling the Nixon Tape Gap|last=Clymer|first=Adam|date=May 9, 2003|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate security expert Phil Mellinger undertook a project to restore Haldeman's handwritten notes describing the missing {{frac|18|1|2}} minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=David Corn |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/09/csi-watergate |title=CSI: Watergate |magazine=Mother Jones |accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though that effort also failed to produce any new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2011/nr11-142.html |title=National Archives Releases Forensic Report on H.R.

===The "smoking gun" tape ===
[[File:Nixon edited transcripts.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nixon releasing the transcripts]]
On April 11, 1974, the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] subpoenaed the tapes of 42 White House conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=[[The Final Days]]| first1=Bob| last1=Woodward| authorlink1=Bob Woodward| first2=Carl| last2=Bernstein| authorlink2=Carl Bernstein| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York, New York| date=1976| isbn=0-6712-2298-8| page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Nixon released more than 1,200 pages of edited transcripts of the subpoenaed tapes, but refused to turn over the actual tapes, claiming executive privilege once more.&lt;ref name=Burglary2004CNN&gt;{{cite news| title=A burglary turns into a constitutional crisis| url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/06/11/watergate/index.html| accessdate=May 13, 2014| work=CNN| date=June 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Judiciary Committee, however, rejected Nixon's edited transcripts, saying that they did not comply with the subpoena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Nixon to Rodino: Description| url=https://history.house.gov/HouseRecord/Detail/15032449719| publisher=Office of the Historian, U.S. House of Representatives| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=December 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirica, acting on a request from Jaworski, issued a subpoena for the tapes of 64 presidential conversations to use as evidence in the criminal cases against indicted former Nixon administration officials. Nixon refused, and Jaworski appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to force Nixon to turn over the tapes. On July 24, 1974, the Supreme Court [[United States v. Nixon|ordered]] Nixon to release the tapes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/court-orders-nixon-to-yield-tapes-president-promises-to-comply-fully/2012/06/04/gJQAZSw0IV_story.html|title=Court Orders Nixon to Yield Tapes; President Promises to Comply Fully|website=Washington Post|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 8–0 ruling (Justice [[William Rehnquist]] recused himself owing to having worked for [[John N. Mitchell|Attorney General John Mitchell]])&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' found that President Nixon was wrong in arguing that courts are compelled to honor, without question, any presidential claim of executive privilege.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The White House released the subpoenaed tapes on August 5. One tape, later known as the "smoking gun" tape, documented the initial stages of the Watergate coverup. On it, Nixon and H. R. Haldeman are heard formulating a plan to block investigations by having the CIA falsely claim to the FBI that national security was involved. This demonstrated both that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and that he had approved plans to thwart the investigation. In a statement accompanying the release of the tape, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had a lapse of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ambrose| first=Stephen E.| authorlink=Stephen E.

Once the "smoking gun" transcript was made public, Nixon's political support practically vanished. The ten Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who had voted against impeachment in committee announced that they would now vote for [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|impeachment]] once the matter reached the House floor. He lacked substantial support in the Senate as well; [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Hugh Scott]] estimated no more than 15 Senators were willing to even consider acquittal. Facing certain impeachment in the House of Representatives and equally certain conviction in the Senate, Nixon announced his resignation on the evening of Thursday, August 8, 1974, effective as of noon the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part3.html|title=The Watergate Story {{!}} Nixon Resigns|website=The Washington Post|access-date=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-presidency ==
After Nixon's resignation, the federal government took control of all of his presidential records, including the tapes, in the [[Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act]] of 1974. From the time that the federal government seized his records until his death, Nixon was locked in frequent legal battles over control of the tapes; Nixon argued that the act was unconstitutional in that it violated the constitutional principles of separation of powers and executive privilege, and infringed on his personal privacy rights and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right of association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawnix.com/cases/nixon-gsa.html|title=Nixon v.

The legal disputes would continue for 25 years, past Nixon's death in 1994. He initially lost several cases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/20004|title=Historian's work gives a glimpse of Nixon "unplugged"|date=November 8, 2011|accessdate=February 14, 2012|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the courts ruled in 1998 that some 820 hours and 42 million pages of documents were his personal private property and had to be returned to his estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/01/news/mn-34946|title=Court Rules Some Nixon Tapes are Private|accessdate=February 14, 2012|date=April 1, 1998|author=Wagner, Michael G.|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nixon had been deceased for four years at the time of this latest court ruling so most experts agree that it was a moot development after years of legal battles over the tapes. 

On July 11, 2007, the National Archives were given official control of the previously privately operated Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in [[Yorba Linda, California]].&lt;ref name="post article"&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:Nixon 30-0316a.jpg|thumb|President [[Richard Nixon]]'s Official Presidential Photograph, taken in 1971]]

"'''Nixon's Enemies List'''" is the informal name of what started as a list of [[President of the United States]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s major political opponents compiled by [[Charles Colson]], written by [[George T. Bell]]&lt;ref name="execsession"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dean |first=John |url=http://bcm.bc.edu/issues/winter_2005/ft_presidents.html#dean |title= The enemies list revisited |work=Boston College Magazine |date=Winter 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (assistant to Colson, [[White House Counsel|special counsel to the White House]]), and sent in [[memorandum]] form to [[John Dean]] on September 9, 1971. The list was part of a campaign officially known as "Opponents List" and "Political Enemies Project".

The list became public knowledge on June 27, 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Axtell|first1=Daniel G.|title=Nixon's First Enemies List|url=http://www.enemieslist.info/list1.php|website=EnemiesList.info|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Dean mentioned during hearings with the [[Senate Watergate Committee]] that a list existed containing those whom the president did not like. Journalist [[Daniel Schorr]], who happened to be on the list, managed to obtain a copy of it later that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/capital-living/20243-journalist-recalls-the-honor-of-being-on-nixons-enemies-list |title=Journalist recalls the honor of being on Nixon's Enemies List |first=Jordy |last=Yager |date=January 6, 2009 |publisher=TheHill.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longer second list was made public by Dean on December 20, 1973, during a hearing with the Congressional Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Axtell|first1=Daniel G.|title=Nixon's Second Enemies List|url=http://www.enemieslist.info/list2.php|website=EnemiesList.info|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[Image:Dean-enemies-1.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Dean]]'s cover memo, dated August 16, 1971.]]
The official purpose, as described by the [[White House Counsel]]'s Office, was to "screw" Nixon's political enemies, by means of tax audits from the [[Internal Revenue Service]], and by manipulating "grant availability, federal contracts, litigation, prosecution, etc."&lt;ref name="dean1971"&gt;Dean, John (August 16, 1971). Dealing with our Political Enemies.&lt;/ref&gt; In a memorandum from [[John Dean]] to [[Lawrence Higby]] (August 16, 1971), Dean explained the purpose of the list:

{{quote|This memorandum addresses the matter of how we can maximize the fact of our incumbency in dealing with persons known to be active in their opposition to our Administration; stated a bit more bluntly—how we can use the available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.&lt;ref name="dean1971"/&gt;}}

The IRS commissioner, [[Donald Alexander (lawyer)|Donald C. Alexander]], refused to launch audits of the people on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]
|first=Patricia
|last=Sullivan
|date=February 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People listed==
The 20 names in the memo in order were as follows, although a [[master list of Nixon's political opponents]] with additional names was developed later.
#[[Arnold Picker]]
#[[Alexander E. Barkan]]
#[[Edwin Guthman]]
#[[Maxwell Dane]]
#[[Charles Dyson]]
#[[Howard Stein]]
#[[Allard Lowenstein]]

#[[Mary McGrory]]

==Master list of political opponents==
{{watergate|Groups}}
{{main|Master list of Nixon's political opponents}}

According to Dean, Colson later compiled hundreds of names on a "master list" which changed constantly. On December 20, 1973, the Congressional Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation concluded that people on the "Enemies" list had ''not'' been subjected to an unusual number of tax audits. The report revealed a second list of about 576 (with some duplicates) supporters and staffers of [[George McGovern]]'s 1972 presidential campaign given to Internal Revenue Commissioner Johnnie Walters by John Dean on September 11, 1972.  ''[[The Washington Post]]'' printed the entire list the next day, but ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported just a few paragraphs on page 21.&lt;ref&gt;Claiborne, William. "IRS Ignored Bid to Audit 'Enemies' List," ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 21, 1973, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, Linda. "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A00E4DD1039E73ABC4951DFB4678388669EDE Congressional Unit Says Dean Gave I.R.S. 2d 'Enemies' List]," ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 21, 1973, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Newsman [[Daniel Schorr]] and actor [[Paul Newman]] stated, separately, that inclusion on the list was their greatest accomplishment. When this list was released, Schorr read it live on television, not realizing that he was on the list until he came to his own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yager |first1=Jordy |title=Journalist recalls the honor of being on Nixon's Enemies List |url=http://thehill.com/capital-living/20243-journalist-recalls-the-honor-of-being-on-nixons-enemies-list |accessdate=July 12, 2018 |work=The Hill |date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author  [[Hunter S. Thompson]] remarked he was disappointed he was not on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thompson|first=Hunter S.|authorlink=Hunter S. Thompson|year=2003|title=The Great Shark Hunt: Strange Tales from a Strange Time|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tESC9BnR85cC&amp;pg=PA239|p=239|isbn=9780743250450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the United States, the term "enemies list" has come to be used in contexts not associated with Richard Nixon. For example, satirist [[P. J. O'Rourke]]'s 1989 "A Call for a New [[McCarthyism]]" in ''[[The American Spectator]]'' has a hybrid [[blacklist]] and enemies list, suggesting that, contrary to the spirits of these lists, the subjects there should be overexposed, not suppressed, "so that a surfeited public rebels in disgust."

In Philip Roth's ''[[Our Gang (novel)|Our Gang]]'', which was published in 1971, two years before the list was first mentioned in public, the Nixon parody character Trick E. Dixon begins to compile a rudimentary list of five political enemies. It includes [[Jane Fonda]] and the [[Black Panthers]] who were on the real-life expanded master list, [[Daniel Berrigan|The Berrigans]] (who were not) and [[Curt Flood]].

In "[[Homer's Enemy]]", an 8th-season episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Moe Szyslak]] shows off his own enemies list, which [[Barney Gumble]] quickly appraises as Nixon's list, with the latter's name crossed out and replaced with Moe's. Moe promptly adds Barney to the list for his insolence.

In ''[[Futurama]]'s'' first episode, "[[Space Pilot 3000]]",  [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] and [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] walk through a room of live preserved heads of famous people. When Fry knocks over Nixon's jar, Nixon says, "That's it, you just made my list!"

In a ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'' second season episode called "The Shot", the title character and Todd visit the Nixon Presidential Library with the intent of stealing a scaled-down replica of the library. Mounted on the walls are Nixon's Enemy and "Frenemy" Lists. [[Walt Disney]] is included on the Enemy List.

In the [[A Christmassy Ted|Father Ted Christmas special]] the titular character has amassed what he describes as ''a list of people who've really [[feck]]ed me down through the years'' with one section for liars and the other for people he regarded as ''[[twats]]''. He reads out the entire list during his awards ceremony.

The '''Watergate complex''' is a group of six buildings in the [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States. Covering a total of 10 acres (4 ha) adjacent to the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], the buildings include:

* Watergate West (2700 Virginia Avenue NW), cooperative apartments
* Watergate 600 (600 New Hampshire Ave NW), office building not involved in the Watergate scandal
* Watergate Hotel (2650 Virginia Avenue NW)
* Watergate East (2500 Virginia Avenue NW), cooperative apartments&lt;ref name="MacPhersonStatus" /&gt;
* Watergate South (700 New Hampshire Avenue NW), cooperative apartments
* Watergate Office Building (2600 Virginia Ave NW), the office building where the Watergate burglary happened&lt;ref name="Hedgpeth"&gt;Hedgpeth, Dana. "Watergate Offices on the Market." ''The Washington Post.'' May 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Built between 1963 and 1971, the Watergate was considered one of Washington's most desirable living spaces, popular with members of Congress and political appointees in the executive branch.&lt;ref name="MacPhersonStatus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Livingston"/&gt; The complex has been sold several times since the 1980s. In the 1990s, it was split up and its component buildings and parts of buildings were sold to various owners.&lt;ref name="Haggerty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sale"/&gt;

In 1972, the headquarters of the [[Democratic National Committee]], then located on the sixth floor of the Watergate Office Building, was [[Burglary|burglarized]]; private campaign documents were photographed and telephones were wiretapped.&lt;ref name="LewisPlot" /&gt;  The investigation into the burglary revealed that high officials in the administration of President [[Richard Nixon]] had ordered the break-in and then tried to cover up their involvement. Additional crimes were also uncovered. The ensuing [[Watergate scandal]], named for the complex, resulted in President Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/06/03/AR2005033108821.html Kilpatrick, Carroll.

===Site history===
For more than a century, the land now occupied by the Watergate complex belonged to the Gas Works of the [[Washington Gas|Washington Gas Light Company]], which produced "[[Coal gas|manufactured gas]]" (a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other flammable and nonflammable gases) for heating, cooking, and lighting throughout the city.&lt;ref name="Penczer"&gt;Penczer, Peter R.

In the 1950s, the [[World Bank]] considered building its international headquarters here and on the adjacent site (which now houses the Kennedy Center), but rejected the site for unspecified reasons. It constructed its headquarters at its current location at 1818 [[H Street (Washington, D.C.)#H Street NW|H Street NW]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/KQAESG7SP0 "World Bank History: The Bank's Headquarters Building."] International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.

==Name origins==
[[File:C&amp;O Canal water gate with Watergate complex in background.jpg|thumb|200px|The C&amp;O Canal terminus at milepost zero. The photo shows the remains of Waste Weir #1, and where the gravity dam used to be. The "Watergate West" building is in the background.]]
The name "Watergate" relates to numerous aspects of its physical and historical context.

The complex sits near the eastern terminus of the [[Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal]], which operated from 1831 to 1924 and is now a [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park|National Historical Park]]. The remains of the gravity dam across Rock Creek, as well as Waste Weir #1 are at this site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies|first=William E.|title=The Geology and Engineering Structures of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal: An Engineering Geologist’s Descriptions and Drawings|url=http://www.candocanal.org/histdocs/Davies-book.pdf|year=1999|location=Glen Echo, Md.|publisher=C&amp;O Canal Association|accessdate=2014-07-21|page=2|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725154533/http://www.candocanal.org/histdocs/Davies-book.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land once owned by the canal company was part of the {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} site purchased in 1960 by the project's developer, Rome-based [[Società Generale Immobiliare]] (SGI).&lt;ref name="projectsite"&gt;{{cite news |title=Watergate East Online |publisher=Watergate East Online |url=http://watergateeast.org/history1.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818052847/http://watergateeast.org/history1.html |archivedate=2012-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2018 book ''The Watergate: Inside America’s Most Infamous Address'', author [[Joseph Rodota]] gave three accounts of the origin of the name, based on sources inside the development team: Author and playwright [[Warren Adler]], while working as a publicist for the developers, came up with the name; Nicolas Salgo, a New York financier who suggested the original site to Societa Generale Immobiliare, acquired the name from Marjory Hendricks, owner of the Water Gate Inn; and three local executives—Giuseppe Cecchi, an employee of Societa Generale Immobiliare, Nicolas Salgo and Royce Ward—came up with the name, inspired in part by the Water Gate Inn, and recommended it to executives in the Rome office for approval. According to Rodota, the earliest use of the name Watergate in the surviving files of Societa Generale Immobiliare is a June 8, 1961 memorandum authored by Giuseppe Cecchi, summarizing an early meeting with officials of the future [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] about the proposed project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Watergate|last=Rodota|first=Joseph|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 book ''Presidential Power on Trial: From Watergate to All the President's Men,'' William Noble wrote that the Watergate "got its name from overlooking the 'gate' that regulated the flow of water from the Potomac River into the Tidal Basin at flood tide."&lt;ref name="noble"&gt;{{cite book |title=Presidential Power on Trial: From Watergate to All the President's Men, William Noble, p. 8 |publisher=Enslow Pub, March 2009 |quote=It got its name from overlooking the 'gate' that regulated the flow of water from the Potomac River into the Tidal Basin at flood tide. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yr8wCjuchI8C&amp;pg=PT9 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131213349/https://books.google.com/books?id=yr8wCjuchI8C&amp;pg=PT9 |archivedate=2017-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That gate (near the [[Jefferson Memorial]]) is about 1½ miles downriver from the Watergate complex.

Another namesake, the "Water Gate Inn" restaurant (1942–1966), operated on the site for more than two decades before the Watergate complex was built.&lt;ref name="saharch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Watergate 1963–1967, Luigi Moretti |publisher=SAH-Archipedia |url=http://sah-archipedia.org/buildings/DC-01-FB15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022123102/http://sah-archipedia.org/buildings/DC-01-FB15 |archivedate=2014-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' writer John Kelly argued that the name was most directly linked to the "Water Steps" or "Water Gate," a set of ceremonial stairs west of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] that led down to the Potomac.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60120-2004Dec12.html Kelly, John.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steps had been originally planned as a ceremonial gateway to the city and an official reception area for dignitaries arriving in Washington, D.C., via water taxi from Virginia, though they never served this function.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; Instead, beginning in 1935, a floating performance stage on the Potomac River was anchored to the base of the steps. It was the site for open-air concerts and the audience could sit on the stairs.&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AIAGuide" /&gt; Up to 12,000 people would sit on the steps and surrounding grass to listen to symphonies, military bands, and operas. The barge concerts ended in 1965 when jet airliner service began at [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|National Airport]] and the noise impaired the venue's viability.&lt;ref name="Spot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AIAGuide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Taps for Watergate Barge."

May 17, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and was intended to help define the area as a business and residential rather than industrial district.&lt;ref name="NewHotel" /&gt; The Watergate complex was intended to be a "city within a city," and provide so many amenities that residents would not need to leave. Among these were a 24-hour receptionist, room service provided by the Watergate Hotel, health club, restaurants, shopping mall, medical and dental offices, grocery, pharmacy, post office, and liquor store.&lt;ref name="Sanchez" /&gt; At the time, it was also the largest renewal effort in the District of Columbia undertaken solely with private funds.&lt;ref name="Clopton" /&gt;

Initially, the project was to cost $75 million and consist of six 16-story buildings comprising 1,400 apartment units, a 350-room hotel, office space, shops, 19 luxury "villas" ([[townhouses]]), and three-level underground parking for 1,250 vehicles.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Willmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EisenTouch" /&gt; The Watergate's curved structures were designed to emulate two nearby elements. The first was the proposed [[Inner Loop (Washington, D.C.)|Inner Loop Expressway]], a curving [[freeway]] expected to be built just in front of the Watergate within the next decade.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Three circumferential [[beltway]]s had been proposed for the Washington, D.C., area in 1956.  The innermost beltway, which would have formed a flattened oval centered on the Kennedy Center/Watergate complex in the west, running southwest along what is currently [[Ohio Drive (Washington, D.C.)|Ohio Drive SW]] until it linked with the Southwest Freeway portion of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|I-395]], north along I-395 to [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|L Street NW]], and then west along a tunnel beneath K Street NW to join near the western nexus with the [[Whitehurst Freeway]] and [[Interstate 66#District of Columbia 2|I-66]]—completing the loop. Two decades of protest led to the cancellation of all but the I-395 portion of the plan in 1977. See: Levey, Bob and Levey, Jane Freundel. "End of The Roads." ''The Washington Post.''

===Approval controversies===
Because the District of Columbia is the seat of the United States government, proposals for buildings in the city (particularly those in the downtown area, near federal buildings and monuments) must pass through an extensive, complex, and time-consuming approval process.  The approval process for the Watergate complex had five stages.  The first stage considered the proposed project as a whole as well as the first proposed building.&lt;ref name="GoAhead" /&gt;  The remaining four stages considered the four remaining proposed buildings in turn.&lt;ref name="GoAhead" /&gt; At each stage, three separate planning bodies were required to give their approval: The [[National Capital Planning Commission]] (NCPC), the [[District of Columbia Zoning Commission]] (DCZC), and the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]] (USCFA) (which had approval authority over any buildings built on the Potomac River to ensure that they fit aesthetically with their surroundings).&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Jean M. "Woes Stall Watergate Project." ''The Washington Post.'' October 18, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1961, 14 months after the project was publicly announced, the [[National Capital Planning Commission]] (NCPC) voiced its concern that the project's 16-story buildings would overshadow the Lincoln Memorial and the proposed "National Cultural Center" (later to be called the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts).&lt;ref name="Clopton"&gt;Clopton, Willard. "Board Opposition Rises to Watergate Apartment Project." ''The Washington Post.'' December 24, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the District of Columbia had a {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=on}} height limit on all buildings except for those located exclusively along business streets.&lt;ref name="Clopton" /&gt; To obtain a height waiver, SGI would have to include retail office space in the complex, but the site was then zoned only for apartment buildings.&lt;ref name="Clopton" /&gt; Thus, initial approval first had to be won from the District of Columbia Zoning Commission.&lt;ref name="Opponents" /&gt;

By the time the DCZC met to consider approval in mid-April 1962, the cost of the project had been scaled back to $50 million.&lt;ref name="Opponents"&gt;"Watergate Project Foes Present Views to Zoners." ''The Washington Post''.  April 14, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the District of Columbia lacked [[District of Columbia home rule|home rule]], DCZC planners were reluctant to act without coordinating with agencies of the federal government.&lt;ref name="Opponents" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GoshkoChange" /&gt; Additionally, many civic leaders, [[architect]]s, [[Businessperson|business people]], and [[Urban planner|city planners]] opposed the project before the DCZC because they feared it was too tall and too large.&lt;ref name="Opponents" /&gt; By the end of April, DCZC had announced that it would delay its decision.&lt;ref name="Isaacs"&gt;Isaacs, Stephen. "Watergate Zoning Hearing Scheduled." ''The Washington Post.'' April 30, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission of Fine Arts also had concerns: it felt some of the land should be preserved as public space&lt;ref name="Clopton" /&gt; and objected to the height of the proposed buildings as well as their [[Modern architecture|modern]] design.&lt;ref name="FineArtsDelay"&gt;"Fine Arts Wins Delay In Watergate Zoning." ''The Washington Post.'' April 19, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after the DCZC meeting, the USCFA announced it was putting a "hold" on the Watergate development until its concerns were addressed.&lt;ref name="FineArtsDelay" /&gt; To counter this resistance, SGI officials met with members of the USCFA in New York City in April 1962 and defended the complex's design.&lt;ref name="Isaacs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxtable, Ada Louise. "Controversy Widens on Design Of Development in Washington." ''The New York Times.'' April 29, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; SGI also reduced the planned height of the Watergate to 14 stories from 16.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;[http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2002/06/17/focus11.html Livingston, Mike. "Watergate: The Name That Branded More Than A Building."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223075238/http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2002/06/17/focus11.html |date=2009-02-23 }} ''[[Washington Business Journal]].'' June 14, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt; In May 1962, the NCPC reviewed the project. Additional revisions in the design plan pushed the cost back up to $65 million, even though only 17 villas were now planned.&lt;ref name="RomanGiant" /&gt; Based on this proposal, the NCPC approved the Watergate plan.&lt;ref&gt;"NCPC Reaffirms Watergate Stand." ''The Washington Post.'' May 11, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of the NCPC, SGI dug in its heels: It declared it was not interested in developing the unsightly, abandoned commercial site unless its basic curvilinear design (now called "Watergate Towne") was approved, and it lobbied DCZC commissioners in late May, lecturing them on the District's architectural heritage and the beauty of modern architecture.&lt;ref name="Sanchez" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goshko, John M. "130-Ft. Height Or Nothing, Say Towne Backers." ''The Washington Post.'' May 16, 1962; "Commissioners Hear Watergate's Designer." ''The Washington Post.'' May 18, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; SGI officials also lobbied the USCFA. Meanwhile, [[White House]] staff made it known that the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] wanted the height of the complex lowered to {{convert|90|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt; Three key staff were opposed to the project on height grounds: [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], Special Assistant to the President; August Heckscher III, Special Consultant on the Arts; and William Walton, a Kennedy family confidante.&lt;ref name="SternWH"&gt;Stern, Laurence. "White House Acts to Cut Height of Huge Watergate Development." ''The Washington Post.'' May 5, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The three briefed [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] on the issue, but it was not clear who made the decision to request the height reduction or who made the request public.&lt;ref name="SternWH" /&gt; The White House announcement surprised many, and offended federal and city planners, who saw it as presidential interference in their activities.&lt;ref name="SternWH" /&gt;

SGI's chief architect, [[Gabor Acs|Gábor Ács]], and Watergate chief architect Luigi Moretti flew to New York City on May 17 and defended the complex's design in a three-hour meeting with USCFA members.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GoshkoChange"&gt;Goshko, John M. "Watergate Apartment Designs Changed by Architect Agreement." ''The Washington Post.'' May 19, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; SGI agreed to shrink three of the planned buildings in the development to 13 stories (112&amp;nbsp;ft), with the remaining building rising to {{convert|130|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GoshkoChange" /&gt; SGI also agreed to add more open space by reducing the size of the Watergate to {{convert|1730000|sqft|m2}} from 1.911 million square feet and by reorienting or re-siting some of the buildings.&lt;ref name="GoshkoChange" /&gt; The USCFA gave its assent to the revised construction plan on May 28, the White House withdrew its objections, and the DCZC gave its final approval on July 13.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaacs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GoshkoWins"&gt;Goshko, John M. "Design for Watergate Towne Development Wins Fine Arts Commission Endorsement." ''The Washington Post.'' May 29, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goshko, John M. "Zoning Board Yields on 130 Feet As Height for Towne Apartments." ''The Washington Post.'' May 30, 1962; Stern, Laurence. "New Watergate Towne Plan Favored." ''The Washington Post.'' July 12, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FinalDCApproval"&gt;"High-Rise Watergate Towne Given Final D.C. Approval." ''The Washington Post.'' July 14, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The final plan broke one building into two, creating five rather than four construction projects.&lt;ref name="GoshkoWins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FinalDCApproval" /&gt; Moretti later admitted he probably would have lowered the height of the buildings anyway,&lt;ref name="EisenTouch" /&gt; and thought that the approval process had gone relatively smoothly.&lt;ref name="WillmanShudders" /&gt; Construction was expected to begin in spring 1963 and last five years.&lt;ref name="FinalDCApproval" /&gt;

The Watergate project faced one final controversy.  The group [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State|Protestants and Other Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] began a national letter-writing campaign opposing the project, alleging that the zoning waivers would not have been given had [[Catholic Church|the Vatican]] not been a major investor in SGI.&lt;ref name="Sanchez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Protestants"&gt;"Towne Plan Stirs Row by Protestants." ''The Washington Post.'' November 17, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-November 1962, more than 2,000 protest letters had been sent to Congress and another 1,500 to the White House.&lt;ref name="Protestants" /&gt; But the group's attempt to stop construction failed, and the project went forward.

The project won its $44 million financial backing in late 1962, and its construction permits in May 1963.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willenson, Kim. "Watergate Towne Gets Financing, Awaits Permit." ''The Washington Post.'' December 14, 1962; "Watergate Plan Clears Final Zoning Hurdle." ''The Washington Post.'' May 4, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began on the first building, the Watergate East apartment, in August 1963.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WGEast"&gt;"Watergate Noses Up." ''The Washington Post.'' October 3, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; The builder was Magazine Bros. Construction.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt; Groundbreaking occurred in August 1963, and major excavation work was complete by May 1964.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;

The U.S. Commission on Fine Arts attempted once more to revise the project.  In October 1963, the USCFA alleged that the height of the Watergate complex, as measured from the parkway in front of it, would exceed the agreed-upon height restrictions.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt; SGI officials, however, contended that architects are required by law to measure from the highest point on the property on which they are to build; using this measurement, the building met the May 1962 agreement stipulations.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt; On January 10, 1963, SGI and the USCFA agreed that the height of the complex would not exceed {{convert|140|ft|m}} above water level (10&amp;nbsp;inches below that of the nearby Lincoln Memorial), that fewer than 300 apartment units would be built (to reduce population congestion), and to eliminate the proposed luxury villas (to create more open space).&lt;ref name="GoAhead"&gt;"Development of Watergate Towne Gets Go-Ahead on Ground Breaking." ''The Washington Post.'' January 25, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Luxury penthouse apartments, however, could extend above the {{convert|140|ft|m|adj=on}} limit if they were [[Setback (architecture)|set back]] from the edge of the building and the 14th floor was foregone.&lt;ref name="GoAhead" /&gt; With these adjustments, the total cost of the first apartment complex (excluding plumbing, electricity, and decoration) was estimated at $12,184,376.&lt;ref name="GoAhead" /&gt;

===Construction===
Construction proceeded. The foundation and basement of the first building, the {{convert|110|ft|m|adj=on}} Watergate East, were completed by September 1964, and the metal and concrete superstructure rose in October.&lt;ref name="WGEast" /&gt; In September 1964, the Watergate's developers signed a first-of-its-kind agreement under which the Washington Gas Light Co. would provide the entire complex with its heating and air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;"Watergate, Gas Co. Sign Unusual Pact." ''The Washington Post.'' September 9, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; The Watergate East was completed in May 1965, and a month later the first model apartment unit was opened to the public for viewing.&lt;ref&gt;"First Watergate Building Nearly Ready." ''The Washington Post.'' May 22, 1965; "Watergate Apartment Model Opens." ''The Washington Post.'' June 19, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;  The building formally opened on October 23, 1965, and the first tenants moved in a few days later.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Formal Opening Wednesday For Watergate East." ''The Washington Post.'' October 24, 1965; "Watergate East Gets First Tenants." ''The Washington Post.'' October 24, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Prices for the 238 [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] units ranged from $17,000 for efficiencies to more than $250,000 for penthouses, and were almost completely sold out by April 1967.&lt;ref name="MacPhersonStatus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NewHotel" /&gt; The average apartment contained two bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths, a dining room, and a kitchen, and cost $60,000.&lt;ref name="MacPhersonStatus" /&gt; Each parking space in the underground garage cost $3,000.&lt;ref name="MacPhersonStatus" /&gt; The tenants took title to their building on April 8, 1966.&lt;ref&gt;"Watergate Operating As 'Co-Op'." ''The Washington Post.'' April 9, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; In November, a [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] [[supermarket]], a [[Peoples Drug]] (now known as [[CVS/pharmacy|CVS pharmacy]]), beauty salon, barber shop, bank, bakery, liquor store, florist, dry cleaner, post office, upscale shops, and high-end restaurant took up residency in the retail space on the ground floor.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NewHotel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InPlace" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"New Peoples Drug Opens in Watergate." ''The Washington Post.'' November 6, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Riverview Realty was the leasing agent for the complex.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;

Construction began on the second building, the 11-story office building and hotel, in February 1965.&lt;ref&gt;"Watergate Project Enters Second Phase." ''The Washington Post.'' February 5, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Both opened on March 30, 1967; the Watergate Hotel welcomed its first guests the same day.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Watergate Apartment Hotel Opens." ''The Washington Post.'' April 1, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The 12-story hotel initially included 213 rooms, while the 12-story office building, attached to the hotel by a [[colonnade]], had {{convert|200000|sqft|m2}} of office space.&lt;ref name="NewHotel" /&gt; The combined hotel/office building included a health club, space on the ground floor for shops, and a restaurant, the Roman Terrace, on the top floor.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NewHotel" /&gt; Later in April, the [[Democratic National Committee]] leased office space in the building's retail office portion.&lt;ref name="Democrats"&gt;"Democrats to Take New Headquarters." ''The Washington Post.'' April 26, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third building in the complex, Watergate South,&lt;ref name="Sanchez" /&gt; opened in June 1968. It contained 260 residential units, more than any other building in the complex.&lt;ref&gt;"Watergate Opening." ''The Washington Post.'' June 23, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the fourth building in the complex, the Watergate West apartments, began in July 1967.&lt;ref&gt;"Fourth Building Started." ''The Washington Post.'' July 1, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Apartments in the unfinished building, priced from $30,000 to $140,000, began selling in October 1967, an indication of how popular the complex was with District residents.&lt;ref name="InPlace" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Watergate Selling In Fourth Building." ''The Washington Post.''

''The Washington Post.'' August 17, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was completed in 1969.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;

===The 5th building===

Controversy arose over the construction of the Watergate Office Building, the complex's fifth and final structure. Its original design called for a {{convert|140|ft|m|adj=on}} structure with the upper floors set back to create more space and light.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt; But in June 1965, as excavation and clearing began for the Kennedy Center, its advocates began agitating to lower the planned height of the final Watergate building.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;Morgan, Dan. "Watergate Facing New Height Fight." ''The Washington Post.'' June 17, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[general counsel]] for the Kennedy Center told the USCFA that the Watergate Town (the development had dropped the "e") was planning a {{convert|170|ft|m|adj=on}} building that would harm the aesthetics of the Kennedy Center and intrude on its park-like surroundings.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt; The Watergate's attorneys responded that their building would stay within the agreed-upon {{convert|140|ft|m|adj=on}} height.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;

The disagreement continued for nearly two years,&lt;ref&gt;"Kennedy Center Protests Apartments." ''The New York Times.'' September 16, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; delaying the planned fall 1967 start to construction.&lt;ref&gt;Meersman, Roger. "The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality." Vol 50. ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society.'' Washington, D.C.: Columbia Historical Society, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Watergate apartment residents such as [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Wayne Morse]] lobbied the USFCA, DCZC, and NCPC to force SGI to accede to the Kennedy Center's wishes.&lt;ref&gt;"Sen. Morse Backs Watergate Plans." ''The Washington Post.'' October 19, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1967, the USCFA reaffirmed its approval of the Watergate project.&lt;ref&gt;"Watergate Plans Reaffirmed." ''The Washington Post.'' November 16, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; When the DCZC appeared on the verge of giving its approval as well, the Kennedy Center argued that the DCZC had no jurisdiction over the controversy.&lt;ref name="WestZoners"&gt;West, Hollie I. "Zoners Firm in Center Fight." ''The Washington Post.'' October 19, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The DCZC disagreed, and re-asserted its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="WestZoners" /&gt; The Kennedy Center then argued that the DCZC had not properly considered its objections, and should delay its approval pending further hearings.&lt;ref name="RulingDueSoon"&gt;"Watergate Ruling Due Soon." ''The Washington Post.'' November 25, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The District's legal counsel disagreed, giving the DCZC the go-ahead to reaffirm (or not) its approval ruling,&lt;ref name="RulingDueSoon" /&gt; which the Zoning Commission did on November 30, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;"Zoning Unit Approves 5th Building in Watergate Project." ''The Washington Post.'' December 1, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it appeared that SGI was winning the legal battle over the fifth building, D.C. city planners attempted to mediate the dispute between the Kennedy Center and the Watergate and achieve a contractual rather than legal solution.  Three separate proposals were made to both sides on December 7, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Hoagland, Jim. "Alternatives Offered in Watergate Rift." ''The Washington Post.'' December 8, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 1968, SGI agreed to turn its fifth building slightly to the southwest in order to open up the Watergate complex a little more and give the Kennedy Center a bit of open space.&lt;ref&gt;"Watergate Defers To Kennedy Center." ''The Washington Post.''April 23, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Kennedy Center accepted the proposal, it demanded that the fifth building include apartment units, rather than be completely devoted to office space, to maintain the area's residential nature.&lt;ref name="Compromise"&gt;"Compromise Plan Ends Watergate Controversy." ''The Washington Post.'' August 9, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The fight now moved to the NCPC.  In June 1968, the NCPC held a hearing at which more than 150 Watergate apartment residents clashed with SGI officials over the nature of the final building.&lt;ref&gt;West, Hollie I. "Board Hears Watergate Zoning Row." ''The Washington Post.'' June 27, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 8, 1968, SGI and the Kennedy Center reached a resolution, agreeing that only 25 percent of the fifth building's {{convert|1700000|sqft|m2}} would be used as office space and that the remaining space would become apartment units.&lt;ref name="Compromise"/&gt; The NCPC approved the revised plan in November 1968, and the DCZC did so five weeks later, specifically zoning the building for [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]] and [[professional]] use only.&lt;ref&gt;Clopton, Willard. "New Design Approved For Watergate Project." ''The Washington Post.'' November 8, 1968; "Commercial Zoning Denied Watergate." ''The Washington Post.'' December 17, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth building was completed in January 1971.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt; Its first tenant was the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which secured occupancy in February 1971, and its first major tenant was the Manpower Evaluation and Development Institute, which leased the entire eighth floor.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt; In October 1972, several high-end fashion boutiques, jewelers, and a restaurant opened in a retail space named "Les Champs."&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;

The total cost of the project was $78 million.&lt;ref name="Sanchez" /&gt;

===Critical reception===
[[File:Watergate complex washington.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Characteristic architecture of the Watergate complex]]
The Watergate's initial reception was poor, but the complex soon became recognized as one of D.C.'s finest examples of modern architecture. When models of the Watergate were unveiled in 1961, critics said the structure "would ruin the waterfront".&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt; Other critics denounced it as "nonconforming" and decried it as "Antipasto on the Potomac".&lt;ref name="Isaacs" /&gt; As noted above, many individuals also felt the complex blocked views of the Potomac River, tended to overshadow nearby monuments and other buildings, and consumed too much open space. Some residents even felt the construction of the units was substandard.&lt;ref name="Titanic"&gt;Carter, Philip D. "Watergate: Potomac Titanic." ''The Washington Post.'' May 3, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural critics called the detailing "clunky".&lt;ref name="AIAGuide" /&gt;

The ''[[Washington Star]]'' newspaper, however, was an early proponent of the Watergate. In May 1962, it editorialized: "It is true that the so-called 'curvilinear' design is at variance with most commercial architecture in Washington. But in our opinion the result, which places a premium on public open space and garden-like surroundings, and which proposes a quality of housing that would rank with the finest in the city, would be a distinct asset."&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt; The curving design has continued to draw praise.  A noted 2006 guidebook to the city's architecture concluded that the Watergate brought a "welcome fluidity" to the city's boxy look.&lt;ref name="AIAGuide" /&gt; Others praised the complex's internal public spaces.  When the Watergate East opened in 1965, ''The Washington Post'' called these areas opulent and evocative of the best in Italian design.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Ruth. "Oriental Opulence and Italian Grandeur." ''The Washington Post.'' June 6, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' characterized the design as "sweeping," and complimented each building's spectacular views of the Potomac River, Virginia skyline, and monuments.&lt;ref name="NewHotel" /&gt; Many residents later said the flowing lines reminded them of a graceful ship.&lt;ref name="MacPhersonStatus" /&gt;

===Watergate II===
In 1970, as the Watergate was nearing completion, SGI proposed building a "Watergate II" apartment, hotel, and office complex on the waterfront in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], across the Potomac River from the original Watergate.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul G. "8-Acre High Rise Site Eyed." ''The Washington Post.'' July 22, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the project initially received support from Alexandria city officials and business people, residents of the city's [[List of neighborhoods in Alexandria, Virginia#Old Town|Old Town]] strongly objected.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul G. "Alexandria Likes Idea of Watergate." ''The Washington Post.'' July 23, 1970; Edwards, Paul G. "Waterfront Plan Backed In Alexandria." ''The Washington Post.'' August 10, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swap"&gt;Omang, Joanne. "Alexandria Land Swap Is Proposed." ''The Washington Post.'' July 21, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The project stalled for two years due to protests from residents and a land dispute regarding title to the waterfront land on which the project was to be sited.&lt;ref name="Swap" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WillmanSecurity"&gt;Willman, John B. "Security to Be Tight At Watergate Landmark." ''The Washington Post.'' September 8, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Watergate II project was eventually abandoned in favor of a much larger complex near [[Landmark Mall]] in Alexandria (a site nowhere near water).&lt;ref name="WillmanSecurity" /&gt;

==Individual buildings at the Watergate==

The boxy building at middle left is the former [[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge]], used during the 1972 Watergate burglaries to monitor the break-ins and wiretaps across the street.]]
The entire Watergate complex was initially owned by Watergate Improvements, Inc., a division of SGI.&lt;ref name="WillmanShudders" /&gt; In 1969, the Vatican sold its interest in SGI and no longer was part-owner of the Watergate.&lt;ref&gt;"Vatican May Sell Watergate Interest." ''The Washington Post.'' June 19, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Watergate was considered one of the most glamorous residences in the city, as early as 1970 residents and businesses complained of substandard construction, including a leaking roof and poor plumbing and wiring.&lt;ref name="Titanic" /&gt;

The three Watergate Apartment buildings total some 600 residential units.&lt;ref name="Cube1" /&gt; Among the many notable past occupants are the following: [[Alfred S.

The Watergate complex changed hands in the 1970s, and each building was sold off separately in the 1990s and 2000s (decade) (see below).

===Watergate East===
The Watergate East apartment building is probably the second-best known of the five buildings in the development. It became the most sought-after living location in the city when it opened in 1966.&lt;ref name="MacPhersonStatus" /&gt;

Problems with the building's construction became apparent shortly after its occupancy.  The roof was leaking by 1968.&lt;ref name="Blackmail"&gt;Bernstein, Carl. "'Blackmail' Charged at Watergate." ''The Washington Post.'' October 31, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' published reports in October 1968 that SGI refused to fix the leaks unless residents dropped their opposition to the construction of the complex's fifth building.&lt;ref name="Blackmail" /&gt; By 1970, problems at Watergate East led the press to dub the building the "Potomac Titanic,"&lt;ref name="Titanic" /&gt; and its residents filed suit against the developer in 1971 to correct the structure's problems.&lt;ref name="InPlace"&gt;"Problems of Watergate, 'In' Place of the Capital, Anger Residents." ''The New York Times.'' March 12, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Another lawsuit, filed in February 1970, sought exclusive access to the underground parking garage the cooperative claimed as its own, and demanded that the developer stop selling spaces in the residents' parking area.&lt;ref name="InPlace" /&gt; SGI filed a $4 million counterclaim alleging "malicious embarrassment" and five years later paid residents $600,000 to settle the cases.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;

The Watergate East was also the site of a major protest in 1970. In the weeks prior to the jury verdict in the trial of the [[Chicago Seven]] (in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]), political activists began planning and then advertising that a protest would occur at the home of [[United States Attorney General]] John N. Mitchell (who lived in the Watergate East).&lt;ref name="Bar"&gt;"Police Bar March on Mitchell Home." ''The New York Times.'' February 20, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; As expected, the verdict was handed down on February 18, 1970 (all the defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy but five were found guilty of incitement to riot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Watergate Hotel and Office Building is one of the five buildings in the Watergate development.

====The Watergate Hotel====
Management and ownership of the hotel have changed several times since the mid-1980s.  In 1986, [[Cunard Line]], the cruise ship company, took over management of the hotel and began redecorating and refurbishing it.&lt;ref&gt;"Cunard to Manage Watergate." ''The Washington Post.''

The Blackstone Group transferred the Watergate Hotel to its Trizec Properties subsidiary.

Euro Capital announced its year-long, $85 million renovation of the hotel in January 2013.

The break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters was not the first break-in at the Watergate. The first break-in, however, shares a remarkable connection with the DNC burglary. The first break-in at the complex was the burglary of a residential unit in 1969.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodsBurglary"&gt;"Nixon Secretary Reports Looting." ''The Washington Post.'' March 3, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The victim was [[Rose Mary Woods]], President Nixon's personal secretary.&lt;ref name="Livingston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodsBurglary" /&gt; The burglars took jewelry and some personal items.&lt;ref name="WoodsBurglary" /&gt; Woods would later be accused of [[Watergate tapes#The 18 1/2-minute gap|erasing 18 and a half minutes]] from President Nixon's secret [[Oval Office]] audio taping system—specifically, the tape from June 20, 1972, that proved central to the Watergate scandal.&lt;ref name="Kutler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Men" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Emery" /&gt;

In 1993, the British coal board pension fund sold the office portion of the building (as well as the land under two of the three Watergate apartment buildings) to [[The JBG Companies]] (an American firm) and Buvermo Properties Inc. (a Dutch company).&lt;ref name="Haggerty" /&gt; In 1997, JBG Cos. and Buvermo Properties sold the office building to the Blackstone Group's Trizec Properties division.&lt;ref&gt;Haggerty, Maryann.

September 30, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Trizec put the office building up for sale for $100 million in 2005 and sold it to BentleyForbes Acquisitions LLC, a private firm owned by C.

===Watergate West===
Construction problems and leaks at Watergate West led the press to ridicule this building, like others in the complex, as the "Potomac Titanic."&lt;ref name="Titanic" /&gt; On March 2, 1971, residents of the Watergate West filed a lawsuit against SGI in which they claimed their units had defective stoves, faulty air conditioning, leaky windows and balconies, and deficient plumbing.&lt;ref name="InPlace" /&gt; SGI said the problems were similar to those with any new building, and that it had already spent $300,000 on repairs.&lt;ref name="InPlace" /&gt;

Like the Watergate East, residents of this building have discussed buying the land beneath their building but do not need to do so until the land lease expires in 2070.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;

''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine owner [[David G. Bradley]] purchased the office building in 2003.&lt;ref name="Sale"/&gt; The new owner renovated the building again, a project which included expanding its lobby and restaurant space.&lt;ref name=sernowashreit /&gt;

In March 2017, [[Washington Real Estate Investment Trust]] (WashREIT) purchased the building from Bradley for $135 million. Under terms of the agreement, Bradley will also become owner of an operating unit{{Efn|An operating unit is an autonomous subsidiary of a corporation which owns assets, incurs liability, and has its own independent management.}} within WashREIT. The new building owner said it would continue renovating various spaces in the structure, as well as upgrade and expand the rooftop amenities and build a new fitness center and new conference center.&lt;ref name=sernowashreit /&gt;

[[File:TheAbbessOfCrewe.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Macmillan (publisher)|Macmillan]])&lt;br&gt;Cover art by Linnet Gotch]]
'''''The Abbess of Crewe''''' is a novella&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckinabook.com/two-more-sparks-abbess-of-crewe-and/ Two More Sparks: The Abbess of Crewe and The Takeover – Stuck in a Book] Retrieved 2019-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1974 by [[Muriel Spark]]. It is centred on a Catholic convent in [[Crewe]] and the political intrigues surrounding the election of a new [[abbess]], after the death of the former. It exhibits Spark's typical style of crossing seamlessly between temporal points in the narrative. [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] adapted the novel into his film ''[[Nasty Habits (film)|Nasty Habits]]'', released in 1977.&lt;ref name= "obit"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dame-muriel-spark-6103520.html |title=Dame Muriel Spark |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book is considered an allegorical treatment of the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name="NYT Review" /&gt;

==Plot summary==
At the beginning of the novel we are introduced to Alexandra, recently elected Abbess of Crewe, circumnavigating the issue of electronic bugging in the convent, while there is a visible police presence outside the gates. Alexandra is tall and elegant, 'like a tower of ivory'. She recites modern poetry in place of the traditional vespers and has the nuns given incantations on electronics. It soon becomes clear that there has been a scandal engulfing the covent and that another senior member of the convent, Felicity, formerly Alexandra's rival for the position of Abbess, has departed to live with a Jesuit priest.

The narrative switches to before the election of Abbess, to times soon before and soon after the death of the former abbess, Hildegarde. Most of the humour derives from Alexandra's implacable calm in the face of chaos and her guileful and downright Machiavellian treatment of her rival, Felicity, and the rest of the convent population. This includes the continuation of Hildegarde's video and audio surveillance systems, used to monitor all the nuns' activities, including Felicity's amorous romps in the garden.

== Characters ==
'''Alexandra''', whose mission and calling is to be the next Abbess of Crewe, irrespective of the methods used.

'''Winifrede''', a gullible and manipulable member of Alexandra's inner circle, treated alternately as dogsbody and scapegoat.

'''Gertrude''', a peripatetic nun, only accessible on the telephone at her own convenience. She grants prosaic and indifferent advice to the inner circle and has an apparently godlike awareness of what is said in her absence.

'''Felicity''', Alexandra's only real rival for the position of Abbess. Her political strategy is to form sewing collectives among the nuns and preach free love.

'''Mildred''', one of the two main supporters and co-conspirators of Alexandra.

'''Walburga''', the second of Alexandra's main co-conspirators. Also fully aware of the extent of bugging within the convent.

'''Baudouin''' and '''Maximilian''', two Jesuit priests who agree to conspire with Alexandra against Felicity when they are given evidence of her romantic trysts with one of their priests.

==Critical reception== 
Muriel Spark subtitled ''The Abbess of Crewe - A Modern Morality Tale''. According to [[George Stade]]'s October 20, 1974 review of ''The Abbess of Crewe'' in the ''[[New York Times]]'', "theological props point to immorality in politics. The setting, to mention names, is the Abbey of Crewe, the immoralities are those of Watergate.", referring to the [[Watergate scandal]] of the 1970s.  That review concluded "Muriel Spark is the first writer to demonstrate that Watergate and its attendant immoralities are materials not of tragedy, but of farce".&lt;ref name="NYT Review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/11/reviews/spark-morality.html |title=The Abbess of Crewe  -  A Modern Morality Tale By Muriel Spark |last=Stade |first=George |date=October 20, 1974}}https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/05/11/reviews/spark-morality.html&lt;/ref&gt;

"The short dirk in the hands of Muriel Spark has always been a deadly weapon,... [and] never more so than in ''The Abbess of Crewe''." - ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=newdirections1995&gt;Muriel Spark, ''The Abbess of Crewe'', New Directions, 1995, {{ISBN|978-0-8112-1296-0}}, back cover&lt;/ref&gt; "Delicious" - ''Newsweek''.&lt;ref name=newdirections1995 /&gt; "Here is, of all things, a Watergate book from Muriel Spark. It is funny, stylish, wicked, and delightful, and represents her return to the buoyant and witty precisions of ''Memento Mori'' and ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie''. Prime Muriel Spark...mad - and hilarious." - ''The Boston Globe''.&lt;ref name=newdirections1995 /&gt; "Groups of females have always been a congenial subject for her, and the nuns...excite her prose to its pristine piquance...[and] pleasing rigor - stylized, sinister, and soothing." - [[John Updike]], ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name=newdirections1995 /&gt;

==Early life and political work==
Stone was born on August 27, 1952,&lt;ref name=toobin/&gt; in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name=rewp47&gt;{{cite news |last=Edsall |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/04/07/partners-in-political-pr-firm-typify-republican-new-breed/8d0b8c04-fabc-43ae-887b-25c7e8af0ec0/ |first=Thomas B. |title=Partners in Political PR Firm Typify Republican New Breed |newspaper=Washington Post |date=April 7, 1985 |accessdate=November 17, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to Gloria Rose (Corbo) and Roger J. Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thehour/obituary.aspx?pid=163187831 |title=Roger J. Stone's Obituary on The Hour|publisher=legacy.com |accessdate=November 17, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Lewisboro, New York]], in a family of Hungarian and Italian descent. His mother was a small-town reporter, his father a well driller&lt;ref name=dswp827&gt;{{cite web |last=Segal |first=David |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/24/AR2007082402122.html |title=Mover, Shaker, And Cranky Caller?

He has described his family as [[middle-class]], [[blue-collar]] Catholics.&lt;ref name=rewp47/&gt;

Stone said that as an elementary school student in 1960, he broke into politics to further [[John F. Kennedy]]'s presidential campaign: "I remember going through the cafeteria line and telling every kid that Nixon was in favor of school on Saturdays&amp;nbsp;... It was my first political trick."&lt;ref name="dswp827" /&gt;

When he was a junior and vice president of student government at his high school in northern [[Westchester County, New York]], he manipulated the ouster of the president and succeeded him. Stone recalled how he ran for election as president for his senior year:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I built alliances and put all my serious challengers on my ticket. Then I recruited the most unpopular guy in the school to run against me. You think that's mean? No, it's smart.&lt;ref name=jhnyt&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Jan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/nyregion/public-lives-the-ego-behind-the-ego-in-a-trump-gamble.html |title=The Ego Behind the Ego in a Trump Gamble |work=The New York Times |date=18 November 1999 |accessdate=November 17, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given a copy of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'', Stone became a convert to [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] as a child and a volunteer in [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|Goldwater's 1964 campaign]]. In 2007, Stone indicated he was a staunch conservative but with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] leanings.&lt;ref name=dswp827/&gt;

As a student at [[George Washington University]] in 1972, Stone invited [[Jeb Magruder]] to speak at a Young Republicans Club meeting, then asked Magruder for a job with [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Committee to Re-elect the President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paybarah |first=Azi |date=September 7, 2007 |title=Roger Stone's Nixon Thing |url=https://observer.com/2007/09/roger-stones-nixon-thing/ |work=[[The New York Observer]] |access-date=July 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624232655/http://www.observer.com/2007/roger-stones-tattoo-alibi |archive-date=June 24, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magruder agreed and Stone then left college to work for the committee.&lt;ref name=toobin/&gt;

==Career==
===1970s: Nixon campaign, Watergate and Reagan 1976===
Stone's political career began in earnest on the 1972 Nixon campaign, with activities such as contributing money to a possible rival of Nixon in the name of the [[Young Socialist Alliance]] – then slipping the receipt to the ''[[Manchester Union-Leader]]''. He also hired a spy in the [[Hubert Humphrey]] campaign who became Humphrey's driver. According to Stone, during the day he was officially a scheduler in the Nixon campaign, but "By night, I'm trafficking in the black arts. Nixon's people were obsessed with intelligence."&lt;ref name="ml"/&gt; Stone maintains he never did anything illegal during [[Watergate]].&lt;ref name=toobin/&gt; The [[Richard Nixon Foundation]] later clarified that Stone had been a 20-year-old junior scheduler on the campaign, and that to characterize Stone as one of Nixon's aides or advisers was a "gross misstatement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kelly |first1=Caroline |title=Nixon Foundation distances itself from Roger Stone after Mueller indictment |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/politics/nixon-foundation-distances-stone/index.html |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |publisher=CNN Politics |date=January 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nixon won the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]], Stone worked for the administration in the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]]. After Nixon resigned, Stone went to work for [[Bob Dole]], but was later fired after columnist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] publicly identified Stone as a Nixon 'dirty trickster'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |date=June 16, 1986 |title=The Rise and Gall of Roger Stone |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/06/16/the-rise-and-gall-of-roger-stone/d8ce308b-7055-4666-860e-378833f46e17/ |last=Mansfield|first=Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Stone helped found the [[National Conservative Political Action Committee]], a [[New Right]] organization that helped to pioneer [[independent expenditure]] political advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Washington Post |date=April 7, 1985 |title=Partners in Political PR Firm Typify Republican New Breed |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/04/07/partners-in-political-pr-firm-typify-republican-new-breed/8d0b8c04-fabc-43ae-887b-25c7e8af0ec0/ |last=Edsall|first=Thomas B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, he worked in [[Ronald Reagan]]'s campaign for U.S. President. In 1977, at age 24, Stone won the presidency of the [[Young Republicans]] in a campaign managed by his friend [[Paul Manafort]]; they had compiled a dossier for each of the 800 delegates that gathered, which they called "whip books".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/paul-manafort-american-hustler/550925/|title=Paul Manafort, American Hustler|first=Franklin|last=Foer|date=March 2018|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone said that [[Roy Cohn]] helped him arrange for [[John B. Anderson]] to get the nomination of the [[Liberal Party of New York]], a move that would help split the opposition to Reagan in the state. Stone said Cohn gave him a suitcase that Stone avoided opening and that, as instructed by Cohn, he dropped off at the office of a lawyer influential in Liberal Party circles. Reagan carried the state with 46% of the vote. Speaking after the [[statute of limitations]] for [[bribery]] had expired, Stone later said, "I paid his law firm. Legal fees. I don't know what he did for the money, but whatever it was, the Liberal party reached its right conclusion out of a matter of principle."&lt;ref name="ml" /&gt;

In 1980, after their key roles in the Reagan campaign, Stone and Manafort decided to go into business together, with partner [[Charlie Black (lobbyist)|Charlie Black]], creating a [[political consulting]] and [[lobbying firm]] to cash in on their relationships within the new administration.

Republican political strategist [[Lee Atwater]] joined the firm in 1985, after serving in the #2 position on Reagan-Bush 1984.

Because of BMS's willingness to represent brutal third-world dictators like [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in the [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in the [[Philippines]], the firm was branded "''The Torturers' Lobby''". BMS also represented a host of high-powered corporate clients, including [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s News Corp, [[The Tobacco Institute]] and, starting in the early 1980s, [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-donald-trump-paul-manafort-ferinand-marcos-philippines-1980s-213952 |first=Kenneth P. |last=Vogel |date=June 10, 2016 |title=Paul Manafort's Wild and Lucrative Philippine Adventure|website=Politico|access-date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fara.gov/docs/3600-Exhibit-AB-19851101-D0XCT601.pdf|title=Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, Public Affairs Company document for U.S. Department of Justice|website=U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act website (FARA.gov)|access-date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=September 25, 1989 |first=Jack |last=Anderson |first2=Dale |last2=Van Atta |authorlink2=Dale Van Atta |authorlink=Jack Anderson (columnist) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/09/25/mobutu-in-search-of-an-image-boost/d0626644-1a49-4414-82b2-70701894dfae/|title=Mobutu in Search of an Image Boost|website=Washington Post|access-date=August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 and 1988, Stone served as senior adviser to [[Jack Kemp]]'s presidential campaign, which was managed by consulting partner Charlie Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Almanac of 1988 Presidential Politics |publisher=Campaign Hotline/ American Political Network |location= |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-9621971-0-9 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same election, his other partners worked for [[George H.

In April 1992, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' alleged that Stone was involved with the controversial [[Willie Horton]] advertisements to aid George H. W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, which were targeted against [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] opponent [[Michael Dukakis]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975347,00.html |accessdate=November 17, 2019 |title=The Political Interest It's Not Going To Be Pretty |date=April 20, 1992 |magazine=Time Magazine |first=Michael |last=Kerner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone has said that he urged Lee Atwater not to include Horton in the ad.&lt;ref name=toobin /&gt; Stone denied making or distributing the advertisement, and said it was Atwater's doing.&lt;ref name=toobin /&gt;

In the 1990s, Stone and Manafort sold their business. Although their careers went in different directions, their relationship remained close.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Stone married his first wife Anne Elizabeth Wesche in 1974. Using the name Ann E.W. Stone, she founded the group [[Republicans for Choice]] in 1989. They divorced in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sherrill |first1=Martha |title=The GOP's abortion-rights upstart |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/04/04/the-gops-abortion-rights-upstart/a697aee6-7d6a-47bf-88a2-d3582a8f78df/?noredirect=on |accessdate=January 25, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=April 4, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s: early work with Donald Trump, Dole 1996===
In 1995, Stone was the president of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Arlen Specter]]'s campaign for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Steven A. |date=November 10, 1995 |title=96 Aspirants Filling Breach Left By Powell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/10/us/96-aspirants-filling-breach-left-by-powell.html |accessdate=November 17, 2019 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specter withdrew early in the campaign season with less than 2% support.

Stone was for many years a lobbyist for [[Donald Trump]] on behalf of his [[casino]] business&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and also was involved in opposing expanded casino gambling in [[New York State]], a position that brought him into conflict with Governor [[George Pataki]].&lt;ref name=tomasky /&gt;

Stone resigned from a post as a consultant to the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 presidential campaign]] for Senator [[Bob Dole]] after ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' reported that Stone had placed ads and pictures on websites and [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers']] publications seeking sexual partners for himself and Nydia Bertran Stone, his second wife. Stone initially denied the report.&lt;ref name=dswp827/&gt;&lt;ref name=jhnyt/&gt; On the ''[[Good Morning America]]'' program he falsely stated, "An exhaustive investigation now indicates that a domestic employee, who I discharged for substance abuse on the second time that we learned that he had a drug problem, is the perpetrator who had access to my home, access to my computer, access to my password, access to my postage meter, access to my post-office box key."&lt;ref name=dswp827/&gt; In a 2008 interview with ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Stone admitted that the ads were authentic.&lt;ref name=toobin/&gt;

===2000s: Florida recount, Killian memos, conflict with Eliot Spitzer===
In 2000, Stone served as campaign manager of Donald Trump's aborted [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2000|campaign for President]] in the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] primary.&lt;ref name=toobin/&gt; Investigative journalist [[Wayne Barrett]] accused Stone of persuading Trump to publicly consider a run for the Reform nomination to sideline [[Pat Buchanan]] and sabotage the Reform Party in an attempt to lower their vote total to benefit George W. Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alissa |last=Wilkinson |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/10/15597328/get-me-roger-stone-netflix-review |title=In Netflix's Get Me Roger Stone, the notorious GOP operative plays both narrator and villain |date=May 10, 2017 |website=[[Vox.com]] |accessdate=November 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, according to Stone and the film ''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]'', Stone was recruited by [[James Baker]] to assist with public relations during the [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|Florida recount]]. His role in the [[Brooks Brothers riot]], the demonstration by Republican operatives against the recount, remains controversial.&lt;ref name=toobin/&gt;

In 2002, Stone was associated with the campaign of businessman [[Thomas Golisano]] for governor of New York State.&lt;ref name=tomasky&gt;{{cite web |last=Tomasky |first=Michael |date=June 17, 2002 |title=The Right Stuff |url=http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/politics/columns/citypolitic/6153/ |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York Metro]] |access-date=May 3, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209204646/http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/politics/columns/citypolitic/6153/ |archive-date=December 9, 2004 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential campaign]], Stone was an advisor (apparently unpaid) to [[Al Sharpton]], a candidate in the [[2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic primaries]].&lt;ref name="unlikely source"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Slackman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/25/us/the-2004-campaign-the-consultant-sharpton-s-bid-aided-by-an-unlikely-source.html |title=The 2004 Campaign: The Consultant: Sharpton's Bid Aided by an Unlikely Source |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 25, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending Stone's involvement, Sharpton said, "I've been talking to Roger Stone for a long time. That doesn't mean that he's calling the shots for me. Don't forget that [[Bill Clinton]] was doing more than talking to [[Dick Morris]]."&lt;ref name=laweekly&gt;{{cite web |last=Ireland |first=Doug |title=A Prayer for Rev.

Sharpton denies that Stone had any influence over his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barrett |first1=Wayne |last2=Suh |first2=Jennifer |date=February 3, 2004 |title=Sharpton's Cynical Campaign Choice |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2004/02/03/sharptons-cynical-campaign-choice/ |work=[[The Village Voice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that election a blogger accused Stone of responsibility for the [[John Kerry|Kerry]]–[[Arlen Specter|Specter]] campaign materials which were circulated in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bunch |first=Will |date=October 15, 2004 |title=Arlen's spectre: Roger Stone |url=http://www.pnionline.com/dnblog/extra/archives/001061.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018001735/http://www.pnionline.com/dnblog/extra/archives/001061.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 18, 2004 |publisher=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |work=Campaign Extra! }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such signs were considered controversial because they were seen as an effort to get Democrats who supported Kerry to vote for then Republican Senator Arlen Specter in heavily Democratic Philadelphia.

During the 2004 general election, Stone was accused by then-[[Democratic National Committee|DNC]] Chairman [[Terry McAuliffe]] of forging the [[Killian documents controversy|Killian memos]] that led CBS News to report that President Bush [[George W. Bush military service controversy|had not fulfilled his service obligations]] while enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard. McAuliffe cited a report in the ''[[New York Post]]'' in his accusations. For his part, Stone denied having forged the documents.&lt;ref name=toobin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chairman-mcauliffe-please-shut-up/ |title=Chairman McAuliffe, Please Shut Up|first=David |last=Corn |date=September 24, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Stone, a top adviser at the time to [[Joseph Bruno]] (the [[Majority Leader of the New York State Senate]]), was forced to resign by Bruno after allegations that Stone had threatened [[Bernard Spitzer]], the then-83-year-old father of Democratic gubernatorial candidate [[Eliot Spitzer]].&lt;ref name="HakiPoliticsSeen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=timesresign&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hakim |first1=Danny |last2=Confessore |first2=Nicholas |author2link=Nicholas Confessore |date=August 23, 2007 |title=Political Consultant Resigns After Allegations of Threatening Spitzer's Father |newspaper=The New York Times |page=B1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/nyregion/23stone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 2007, an expletive-laced message was left on the elder Spitzer's answering machine threatening to prosecute the elderly man if he did not implicate his son in wrongdoing. Bernard Spitzer hired a private detective agency that traced the call to the phone of Roger Stone's wife. Roger Stone denied leaving the message, despite the fact that his voice was recognized, claiming he was at a movie that was later shown not to have been screened that night. Stone was accused on an episode of ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' on August 22, 2007, of being the voice on an expletive-laden voicemail threatening Bernard Spitzer, father of Eliot, with subpoenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnicle |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Barnicle |date=August 23, 2007 |title=August 22nd transcript |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/20408966 |accessdate=November 17, 2019 |work=Hardball with Chris Matthews |publisher=NBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=assumed to be Roger Stone |date=August 2007 |title=Bernard Spitzer's voicemail |url=https://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/audio/nyregion/20070821_voicemail.mp3 |accessdate=November 17, 2019 |format=MP3 |medium=voicemail |publisher=The New York Times |quote=And there's not a goddamn thing your phony, psycho, piece-of-shit son can do about it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Trump]] is quoted as saying of the incident, "They caught Roger red-handed, lying. What he did was ridiculous and stupid."&lt;ref name=toobin/&gt;

Stone consistently denied the reports. Thereafter, however, he resigned from his position as a consultant to the New York State Senate Republican Campaign Committee at Bruno's request.&lt;ref name=timesresign /&gt;

In January 2008, Stone founded Citizens United Not Timid, an anti-[[Hillary Clinton]] [[527 group]] with an intentionally [[Cunt|obscene acronym]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Labash |first=Matt |date=January 28, 2008 |title=Making Political Trouble: Roger Stone shows how its done–again |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/making-political-trouble |accessdate=November 17, 2019 |magazine=The Weekly Standard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone is featured in ''[[Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story]]'', documentary on Lee Atwater made in 2008. He also was featured in ''[[Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer]]'', the 2010 documentary of the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal]].

Former Trump aide [[Sam Nunberg]] considers Stone his mentor during this time, and "surrogate father".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/07/roger-stones-conspicuously-worded-denials-of-wrongdoing-in-the-russia-probe |title=The Fix Analysis; Roger Stone's conspicuously worded denials of wrongdoing in the Russia probe |first=Aaron |last=Blake |date=March 7, 2018 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=March 8, 2018 |quote=This led to plenty of speculation that Nunberg sensed trouble for his mentor, Stone.

===2010s: Libertarian Party involvement, Donald Trump campaign and media commentary===
In February 2010, Stone became campaign manager for [[Kristin M. Davis|Kristin Davis]], a [[madam]] linked with the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal, in her bid for the [[Libertarian Party of New York|Libertarian Party]] nomination for governor of New York in the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 election]]. Stone said that the campaign "is not a hoax, a prank or a publicity stunt. I want to get her a half-million votes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/kristin-davis-alleged-eliot-spitzer-madam-run-new-york-governor-gop-roger-stone-article-1.168588 |title=Kristin Davis, alleged Eliot Spitzer madam, to run for New York governor with GOP Roger Stone's help |date=February 7, 2010 |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=November 17, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later was spotted at a campaign rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Carl Paladino]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vielkind |first=Jimmy |date=April 6, 2010 |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/24524/hi-roger/ |title=Hi, Roger! |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412052719/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/24524/hi-roger/ |archivedate=April 12, 2010 |work=Capitol Confidential, Albany Times Union |accessdate=April 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of whom Stone has spoken favorably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stone |first=Roger |date=March 24, 2010 |title=New York GOP Rumble |work=The Stone Zone |url=https://stonezone.com/article.php?id=325 |accessdate=April 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone admittedly had been providing support and advice to both campaigns on the grounds that the two campaigns had different goals: Davis was seeking to gain permanent ballot access for her party, and Paladino was in the race to win (and was Stone's preferred candidate). As such, Stone did not believe he had a conflict of interest in supporting both candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hakim |first=Danny |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/nyregion/12stone.html |title=Opposing Campaigns, with One Unlikely Link: Roger Stone Plays Role in Two Opposing Campaigns |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 12, 2010 |date=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While working for the Davis campaign, [[Warren Redlich]], the Libertarian nominee for Governor, alleged that Stone collaborated with a group entitled "People for a Safer New York" to send a flyer labeling Redlich a "sexual predator" and "sick, twisted pervert" based on a blog post Redlich had made in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vielkind |first=Jimmy |date=October 29, 2010 |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/33677/stone-i-pushed-for-redlich-mailer/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107010205/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/33677/stone-i-pushed-for-redlich-mailer/ |archivedate=November 7, 2017 |title=Stone: I pushed for Redlich mailer |work=Albany Times-Union |accessdate=November 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redlich later sued Stone in a New York court for defamation over the flyers, and sought $20 million in damages. However, the jury in the case returned a verdict in favor of Stone in December 2017, finding that Redlich failed to prove Stone was involved with the flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/roger-stone-wins-lawsuit-and-is-cleared-of-defamation-charges |title=Roger Stone wins lawsuit and is cleared of defamation charges |work=[[Washington Examiner]] |first= Diana Stancy |last=Correll |date=December 16, 2017 |accessdate=November 17, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Stone said that he had changed his party affiliation from the Republican Party to the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. Stone predicted a "Libertarian moment" in 2016 and the end of the Republican party.&lt;ref name=LP-WashPost&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/gop-trickster-roger-stone-defects-to-libertarian-party/2012/02/16/gIQASIvUIR_blog.html |accessdate=November 17, 2019 |title=GOP trickster Roger Stone defects to Libertarian party |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Stone said that he was running a [[super PAC]] in support of former [[Governor of New Mexico|New Mexico governor]] and Libertarian presidential candidate [[Gary Johnson]], whom he had met at a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine Christmas party two years earlier.&lt;ref name="SteinJohnson"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Stein |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roger-stone-nixon-gary-johson_n_1572063 |accessdate=November 17, 2019 |title=Roger Stone, Nixon Operative and Famed Dirty Trickster, Building Gary Johnson Super PAC |work=Huffington Post |date=June 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone told the ''Huffington Post'' that Johnson had a real role to play, although "I have no allusions {{sic}} of him winning."&lt;ref name="SteinJohnson"/&gt;

Stone considered running as a [[Libertarian Party of Florida|Libertarian]] candidate for [[governor of Florida]] in 2014, but in May 2013 said in a statement that he would not run, and that he wanted to devote himself to campaigning in support of a [[Florida Amendment 2 (2014)|2014 constitutional amendment on the Florida ballot to legalize medical marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caputo|first=Marc |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/roger-stone-why-i-wont-run-for-florida-governor/2123241 |title=Roger Stone: Why I won't run for Florida governor |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=May 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926183804/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/roger-stone-why-i-wont-run-for-florida-governor/2123241 |accessdate=November 17, 2019 |archive-date=September 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2018, two sources close to Stone, former Trump aide [[Sam Nunberg]] and a person speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged to ''The Washington Post'' that Stone had established contact with WikiLeaks owner Julian Assange and that the two had a telephone conversation discussing emails related to the Clinton campaign which had been leaked to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name="stoneassange" /&gt; According to Nunberg, who claimed he spoke to the paper after being asked to do so by Special Counsel Robert Mueller,&lt;ref name="stoneassange" /&gt; Stone joked to him that he had taken a trip to London to personally meet with Assange, but declined to do so, had only wanted to have telephone conversations to remain undetected and did not have advance notice of the leaked emails.&lt;ref name="stoneassange" /&gt; The other source, who spoke on anonymity, stated that the conversation occurred before it was publicly known that hackers had obtained the emails of Podesta and of the Democratic National Committee, documents that WikiLeaks released in July and October 2016.&lt;ref name="stoneassange" /&gt; Stone afterwards denied that he had contacted Assange or had known in advance about the leaked emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/13/politics/roger-stone-wikileaks-contact/index.html |date=March 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 17, 2019 |title=Stone denies report that he had contact with Assange in 2016 |first=Maegan |last=Vazquez |work=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2018, U.S. District Court Judge [[Ellen Huvelle]] dismissed a lawsuit brought by political activist group Protect Democracy, alleging that Donald Trump's campaign and Stone conspired with Russia and WikiLeaks to publish hacked Democratic National Committee emails during the 2016 presidential election race.

On February 18, 2019, Stone posted on [[Instagram]] a photo of the federal judge overseeing his case, [[Amy Berman Jackson]], with what resembled rifle scope crosshairs next to her head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roger-stone-judge-instagram_n_5c6b1233e4b0b9cc78ff507e|title=Roger Stone Attacks Judge Presiding Over His Case In Bizarre Instagram Post|last=Campbell|first=Andy|date=February 18, 2019|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=21 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, Stone filed an apology with the court.

During the November 12 testimony, former Trump campaign deputy chairman [[Rick Gates (political consultant)|Rick Gates]] testified that Stone told campaign associates in April 2016 of WikiLeaks plans to release documents, far earlier than previously known. Gates also testified that Trump had spoken with Stone about the forthcoming releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/12/roger-stone-trial-wikileaks-069831 |first=Darren |last=Samuelsohn |first2=Matthew |last2=Choi |date=November 12, 2019 |title=Stone previewed WikiLeaks bounty to Trump campaign in April 2016 |work=[[Politico]] |accessdate=November 17, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a week-long trial and two days of deliberations, the jury convicted Stone on all counts – obstruction, making false statements, and witness tampering – on November 15, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/trump-friend-roger-stone-found-guilty-of-lying-to-congress.html |title=Trump ally Roger Stone found guilty of lying to Congress, witness tampering |last=Breuninger |first=Kevin |date=2019-11-15 |work=CNBC |access-date=2019-11-15 |last2=Mangan |first2=Dan |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Rachel Weiner, Spencer S.

==== Sentencing ====
Stone's sentencing was initially set for February 6, 2020 after the judge rejected a prosecution request that he be immediately jailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/latest-roger-stone-remain-free-pending-sentencing-67044838|title=The Latest: Roger Stone to remain free pending sentencing|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, 2019 Stone's lawyers requested sentencing be delayed until sometime after March 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/19/trump-ally-roger-stone-asks-for-delay-in-criminal-sentencing.html|title=Trump ally Roger Stone asks for delay in criminal sentencing in WikiLeaks lie case|last=Mangan|first=Dan|date=2019-12-19|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ'' (with Mike Colapietro contributing) (Skyhorse Publishing, 2013): Stone contends that [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was behind a [[John F.

* ''Nixon's Secrets: The Rise, Fall and Untold Truth about the President, Watergate, and the Pardon'' (Skyhorse Publishing, 2014): Stone discusses [[Richard Nixon]] and his career. About two-thirds of the book "is a conventional biography that is by no means a whitewash of Nixon. Stone writes that the President took campaign money from the mob, had a long-running affair with a Hong Kong woman who may have been a Chinese spy, and even once unwittingly smuggled three pounds of marijuana into the United States when carrying the suitcase of jazz great [[Louis Armstrong]]." The remaining one-third of the book is an unconventional account of the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name="GarvinBooks"&gt;{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Garvin |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article2766816.html |title=Hatchet job: Roger Stone's edgy takes on history and politics |work=Miami Herald |date=October 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone portrays Nixon as a "confused victim" and claims that [[John Dean]] orchestrated the break-in (which he depicts as ordinary politics of the time&lt;ref name="Schwab"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nikki |last=Schwab |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/10/22/roger-stone-thinks-richard-nixon-had-a-mistress |title=Did Richard Nixon Have a Mistress? |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |date=October 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to cover up involvement in a prostitution ring. This account is rejected by experts, such as Watergate researchers [[Anthony Summers]] and [[Max Holland]]. Holland said of Stone: "He's out of his ever-lovin' mind."&lt;ref name="GarvinBooks"/&gt; Dean said in 2014 that Stone's book and his defense of Nixon are "typical of the alternative universe out there" and "pure bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Strupp |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/roger-stone/former-nixon-counsel-john-dean-right-wing-media-impeachment-calls-watergate-comparisons |title=Former Nixon Counsel John Dean: Right-Wing Media Impeachment Calls, Watergate Comparisons 'Absolutely Silliness' |work=[[Media Matters For America]] |date=August 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Clintons' War on Women'' (with [[Robert Morrow (Texas politician)|Robert Morrow]] of Austin, Texas) (Skyhorse Publishing, 2015): This book, according to ''[[Politico]]'', is a "[[Sensationalism|sensational]]" work that contains "explosive, but highly dubious, revelations about both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Clinton]]", with a focus on [[Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations]], and a claim that [[Webster Hubbell]] is the biological father of [[Chelsea Clinton]].

* ''Jeb! and the Bush Crime Family'' (with Saint John Hunt) (Skyhorse Publishing, 2016): The book focuses on [[Jeb Bush]] and the [[Bush family]].&lt;ref name="SmithBook"/&gt;
* ''The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution'' (Skyhorse Publishing, 2017): Susan J. McWilliams, Professor of Politics at Pomona College, wrote in her review of the book that "[a]side from some minor revelations about how long Trump planned what would later appear to be spontaneous decisions—he trademarked the slogan "Make America Great Again" in 2013—there's very little Trump, doing very little orchestrating, in these pages" and that "[t]here are many provocative political musings here, but they get lost in Stone's avaricious appetite for self-promotion and grudge-holding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McWilliams |first=Susan |url=https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/making-president-2016 |title=The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution |website=New York Journal of Books |access-date=March 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Watergate}}

'''Richard Nixon's resignation speech''' was an address made on August 8, 1974, by [[President of the United States]] [[Richard Nixon]] to the American public. It was delivered in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]]. The purpose of the speech was for Nixon to announce that he was resigning from office.

Nixon's resignation was the culmination of what he referred to in his speech as the "long and difficult period of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]," the [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|federal political scandal]] stemming from the June 17, 1972, break-in of the [[Democratic National Committee]] headquarters at the [[Watergate Office Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], by five men and the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon#Administration|Nixon administration's]] subsequent attempts to cover up its involvement in the crime. Nixon ultimately lost much of his popular and political support as a result of the scandal. At the time of his resignation, he faced almost certain [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] and removal from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title=Remembering The Emotional Fallout From Nixon's Resignation| access-date=January 2, 2020| series=Morning Edition| last=Wertheimer| first=Linda| authorlink=Linda Wertheimer| network=NPR| date=August 8, 2014| url=https://www.npr.org/2014/08/08/338776824/remembering-the-emotional-fallout-from-nixon-s-resignation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his address, Nixon said he was resigning because "I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the nation would require." He also stated his hope that, by resigning, "I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America." Nixon acknowledged that some of his judgments "were wrong," and he expressed contrition, saying: "I deeply regret any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision." He made no mention, however, of the articles of impeachment pending against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;| title=Nixon Resigns| series=The Watergate Story| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part3.html| work=The Washington Post| accessdate=January 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning, August 9, Nixon submitted a signed letter of resignation to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]], becoming the first U.S. president to resign from office. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Gerald Ford]] succeeded to the presidency upon Nixon's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --&gt;| title=News Summary and Index Saturday, August 10, 1974: The presidency| date=August 10, 1974| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/10/archives/news-summary-and-index-the-major-events-of-the-day-the-presidency.html| work=The New York Times| accessdate=January 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
With the release on August 5, 1974 of several [[Watergate tapes|taped Oval Office conversations]], one of which was the "smoking gun" tape, recorded soon after the break-in, and which demonstrated that [[Richard Nixon]] had been told of the [[White House]] connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and had approved plans to thwart the investigation, Nixon's [[Consent of the governed|popular support]] all but evaporated,&lt;ref name=schmidt&gt;{{citation|quote=In 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of a scandal when it was obvious that public opinion no longer supported him.|title=American Government and Politics Today, 2013-2014 Edition|authorlink1=Steffen Schmidt|first=Steffen W.|last=Schmidt|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1133602132|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his political support collapsed.

Nixon met with Republican congressional leaders two days later, and was told he faced certain impeachment in the House and removal from office in the Senate. That night, knowing his presidency was effectively over, Nixon finalized his decision to resign.&lt;ref name="herbers"&gt;{{cite news |last=Herbers |first=John |date=August 8, 1974 |title=Nixon Resigns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0808.html#article |url-status=live |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lasthours&gt;{{cite web| title=The Last Hours of the Nixon Presidency, 40 Years Ago| date=August 8, 2014| first=Christopher| last=Klein| work=History in the Headlines| url=http://www.history.com/news/the-last-hours-of-the-nixon-presidency-40-years-ago|publisher=[[A&amp;E Networks]]| location=New York| accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president's speechwriter [[Ray Price (speechwriter)|Raymond K. Price]] wrote the resignation speech.&lt;ref name="herbers" /&gt; It was delivered on the evening of August 8, 1974 from the Oval Office and was carried live on radio and television.&lt;ref name=lasthours/&gt;

==Critical reaction and analysis==
[[Jack Nelson (journalist)|Jack Nelson]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that Nixon's speech "chose to look ahead," rather than focus on his term.&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Jack |date=August 9, 1974 |title=Nixon Resigns in 'Interests of Nation': Cites His Achievements for Peace as His Legacy |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles|id={{ProQuest|157487215}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; This attribute of the speech coincides with John Poulakos's definition of sophistical [[rhetoric]] in ''Towards a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric'', because Nixon met the criterion of "[seeking] to capture what was possible"&lt;ref name="rhetpaper"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poulakos |first=John |year=1983 |title=Towards a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric |journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric |volume=16 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of reflecting on his term.

In the British paper ''[[The Times]]'' the article ''Mr. Nixon resigns as President; On this day'' by Fred Emery took a more negative stance on the speech, characterizing Nixon's apology as "cursory" and attacking Nixon's definition of what it meant to serve a full presidential term. Emery suggests Nixon's definition of a full presidential term as "until the president loses support in Congress" implies that Nixon knew he would not win his impending impeachment trial and he was using this definition to quickly escape office.&lt;ref name="emery"&gt;{{cite news |last=Emery |first=Fred |date=August 9, 1999 |title=Nixon Resigns in 'Interests of Nation': Cites His Achievements for Peace as His Legacy|newspaper=The Times|location=London, England|publisher=Times Newspapers|id={{ProQuest|157487215}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Nixon: Ruin and Recovery 1973-1990'', [[Stephen Ambrose]] finds that response from United States media to Nixon's speech was generally favorable. This book cites [[Roger Mudd]] of [[CBS News]] as an example of someone who disliked the speech. Mudd noted that Nixon re-framed his resignation speech to accent his accomplishments rather than to apologize for the Watergate scandal.&lt;ref name="ambrose"&gt;Ambrose, Stephen E. (1991).

In 1999, 137 scholars of American [[Public speaking|public address]] were asked to recommend speeches for inclusion on a list of "the 100 best American political speeches of the 20th century," based on "social and political impact, and rhetorical artistry." Nixon's resignation speech placed 39th on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Top 100 Speeches| url=https://www.americanrhetoric.com/newtop100speeches.htm| website=americanrhetoric.com| accessdate=January 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text ==
{{quote|Good evening. This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office, where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this Nation. Each time I have done so to discuss with you some matter that I believe affected the national interest.

In all the decisions I have made in my public life, I have always tried to do what was best for the Nation. Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me.

In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future.

But with the disappearance of that base, I now believe that the constitutional purpose has been served, and there is no longer a need for the process to be prolonged.

I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations.

From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation would require.

I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first.

America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad.

To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home.

Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office.

As I recall the high hopes for America with which we began this second term, I feel a great sadness that I will not be here in this office working on your behalf to achieve those hopes in the next 2 1/2 years. But in turning over direction of the Government to Vice President Ford, I know, as I told the Nation when I nominated him for that office 10 months ago, that the leadership of America will be in good hands.

In passing this office to the Vice President, I also do so with the profound sense of the weight of responsibility that will fall on his shoulders tomorrow and, therefore, of the understanding, the patience, the cooperation he will need from all Americans.

As he assumes that responsibility, he will deserve the help and the support of all of us. As we look to the future, the first essential is to begin healing the wounds of this Nation, to put the bitterness and divisions of the recent past behind us, and to rediscover those shared ideals that lie at the heart of our strength and unity as a great and as a free people.

By taking this action, I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America.

I regret deeply any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision. I would say only that if some of my judgments were wrong, and some were wrong, they were made in what I believed at the time to be the best interest of the Nation.

To those who have stood with me during these past difficult months, to my family, my friends, to many others who joined in supporting my cause because they believed it was right, I will be eternally grateful for your support.

And to those who have not felt able to give me your support, let me say I leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed me, because all of us, in the final analysis, have been concerned with the good of the country, however our judgments might differ.

So, let us all now join together in affirming that common commitment and in helping our new President succeed for the benefit of all Americans.

I shall leave this office with regret at not completing my term, but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your President for the past 5 1/2 years. These years have been a momentous time in the history of our Nation and the world. They have been a time of achievement in which we can all be proud, achievements that represent the shared efforts of the Administration, the Congress, and the people.

But the challenges ahead are equally great, and they, too, will require the support and the efforts of the Congress and the people working in cooperation with the new Administration.

We have ended America's longest war, but in the work of securing a lasting peace in the world, the goals ahead are even more far-reaching and more difficult. We must complete a structure of peace so that it will be said of this generation, our generation of Americans, by the people of all nations, not only that we ended one war but that we prevented future wars.

We have unlocked the doors that for a quarter of a century stood between the United States and the People's Republic of China.

We must now ensure that the one quarter of the world's people who live in the People's Republic of China will be and remain not our enemies but our friends.

In the Middle East, 100 million people in the Arab countries, many of whom have considered us their enemy for nearly 20 years, now look on us as their friends. We must continue to build on that friendship so that peace can settle at last over the Middle East and so that the cradle of civilization will not become its grave.

Together with the Soviet Union we have made the crucial breakthroughs that have begun the process of limiting nuclear arms. But we must set as our goal not just limiting but reducing and finally destroying these terrible weapons so that they cannot destroy civilization and so that the threat of nuclear war will no longer hang over the world and the people.

We have opened the new relation with the Soviet Union. We must continue to develop and expand that new relationship so that the two strongest nations of the world will live together in cooperation rather than confrontation.

Around the world, in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America, in the Middle East, there are millions of people who live in terrible poverty, even starvation. We must keep as our goal turning away from production for war and expanding production for peace so that people everywhere on this earth can at last look forward in their children's time, if not in our own time, to having the necessities for a decent life.

Here in America, we are fortunate that most of our people have not only the blessings of liberty but also the means to live full and good and, by the world's standards, even abundant lives. We must press on, however, toward a goal of not only more and better jobs but of full opportunity for every American and of what we are striving so hard right now to achieve, prosperity without inflation.

For more than a quarter of a century in public life I have shared in the turbulent history of this era. I have fought for what I believed in. I have tried to the best of my ability to discharge those duties and meet those responsibilities that were entrusted to me.

Sometimes I have succeeded and sometimes I have failed, but always I have taken heart from what Theodore Roosevelt once said about the man in the arena, "whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deed, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly."

I pledge to you tonight that as long as I have a breath of life in my body, I shall continue in that spirit. I shall continue to work for the great causes to which I have been dedicated throughout my years as a Congressman, a Senator, a Vice President, and President, the cause of peace not just for America but among all nations, prosperity, justice, and opportunity for all of our people.

There is one cause above all to which I have been devoted and to which I shall always be devoted for as long as I live.

When I first took the oath of office as President 5 1/2 years ago, I made this sacred commitment, to "consecrate my office, my energies, and all the wisdom I can summon to the cause of peace among nations."

I have done my very best in all the days since to be true to that pledge. As a result of these efforts, I am confident that the world is a safer place today, not only for the people of America but for the people of all nations, and that all of our children have a better chance than before of living in peace rather than dying in war.

This, more than anything, is what I hoped to achieve when I sought the Presidency. This, more than anything, is what I hope will be my legacy to you, to our country, as I leave the Presidency.

To have served in this office is to have felt a very personal sense of kinship with each and every American. In leaving it, I do so with this prayer: May God's grace be with you in all the days ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |first=Richard |last=Nixon |authorlink=Richard Nixon |title=Richard Nixon's resignation speech| date=August 8, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
